1. A DISCOURSE OF CONSTANCY.

    _ BOOK I.

      * CHAP. I. The Preface and Introduction, a Complaint of the troubles of Belgia.

      * CHAP. II. That Travaile availes not againſt thoſe Diſeaſes which are within us. It is rather a Symptome than a Cure: unleſs in ſome firſt and light motion of the Affections.

      * CHAP. III. That the true Diſeaſes of the Mind are not removed by travail, but are thereby the more exaſperated. That it is the Mind which is ſick; a remedy for which is to be ſought for from VViſdom and Conſtancy.

      * CHAP. IV. The Definitions of Conſtancy; Patience; Right Reaſon and Opinion: The difference betwixt Obſtinacy and Conſtancy, and betwixt Patience and Stupidity.

      * CHAP. V. The Originals of Reaſon and Opinion. The Power and Effects of each. That leads to Conſtancy; this to Levity.

      * CHAP. VI. The praiſe of Conſtancy, and a ſerious exhortation to purſue it.

      * CHAP. VII. VVhat it is and how manifold, that oppoſes Conſtancy: they are external good and evil things. Thoſe evils are twofold, Publick and Private; thoſe which are Publick ſeem the moſt grievous and dangerous.

      * CHAP. VIII. Publick Evils oppos'd. Three Affections reſtrain'd: and of theſe; Firſt, a certain Ambitious Simulation, by which Men lament their own misfortunes as Publick Evils.

      * CHAP. IX. A clearer diſcovery of this Simulation by Examples; ſomething (by the way) of our true Country. Of that malice in Men, which occaſions them to rejoyce in the Evils of others, when themſelves are ſecure.

      * CHAP. X. A Complaint of Langius his ſo liberal Reproof. That it is the part of a Philoſopher. Endeavours of refuting what was before ſaid. Our Obligation and Love to our Country.

      * CHAP. XI. The Second Affection of too much Love to our Country refuted. That it is falſly call'd Piety. As alſo whence this Affection hath its Original. What is properly and truly our Country.

      * CHAP. XII. The third Affection which is Commiſeration rectifyed to indulge it over much, a Vice. Its difference from Mercy. How and with what reſpect it is to be admitted.

      * CHAP. XIII. Theſe Impediments remov'd, Publick Evils themſelves are ſeriouſly conſidered. Four Arguments propounded againſt them. Of Providence; that it is intereſted in, and preſides over all humane affairs.

      * CHAP. XIV. Nothing done here below but by the Previdence of God. Calamities upon People and Cities from thence. It is not therefore piouſly done to complain of, or lament them. An Exhortation to obey God, with whom it is vanity and raſhneſs to contend.

      * CHAP. XV. The Second Argument for Conſtancy, drawn from Neceſſity. Its force and Efficacy. Neceſſity deriv'd from two Grounds; and firſt from the things themſelves.

      * CHAP. XVI. Inſtances of Neceſſary Mutation and Death throughout the whole VVorld. The Heavens and Elements change, and ſhall paſs away. The ſame is diſcernable in Cities, Provinces, and Kingdomes. All things here are wheel'd about, and nothing is ſtable or firme.

      * CHAP. XVII. Of the Neceſſity that is from Fate. Fate aſſerted, the univerſal aſſent both of the Learned and of the people to it; though ſome difference about its parts. How the ancients diſtinguiſhed of Fate.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The three Firſt kinds of Fate briefly explained. The deſcription of them. The Stoicks in part excuſed.

      * CHAP. XIX. The Fourth, true Fate explained. Of its Name, its Definition. How it differs from Providence.

      * CHAP. XX. Its Difference from the Stoicks Fate; in four reſpects. That it offers no violence to the will. That God is neither a Copartner in, nor the Author of Evil.

      * CHAP. XXI. The Concluſion of the Diſcourſe about Fate; that it is dangerous and doubtfull, not curiouſly to be pry'd into. An exhortation to ſtrengthen our Minds from the conſideration of Neceſſity.

      * CHAP. XXII. A pretence for Sloth uſually drawn from Fate. Its Detection. Fate acts by ſecond cauſes, and therefore they not to be idle. How farr we are to help our Country, and when to forbear. The Cloſe of the firſt Diſcourſe.

      * CHAP. I. The occaſion of renewing the Diſcourſe; the going to Langius his Gardens. Their commendations.

      * CHAP. II. The praiſe of Gardens in general. Delight taken in them is ancient, and from Nature. Kings and other excellent perſons addicted to them. The pleaſures of them.

      * CHAP. III. Againſt ſome curious People, who abuſe their Gardens to Vanity and Sloth. Their proper uſe. That they are places fit for wiſe and learned Men; and that VViſdom it ſelf is bred and cheriſhed there.

      * CHAP. IV. An exhortation to VViſdom; thereby a Man may attain to Conſtancy. An admonition to Youth, to conjoyn the more ſerious ſtudies of Philoſophy to the more pleaſant and liberal ones.

      * CHAP. V. Wiſdom is not acquir'd by wiſhes, but endeavours. The diſcourſe of Conſtancy renew'd. The deſire of knowledge, a happy preſage in a Young Man.

      * CHAP. VI. A third Argument for Conſtancy drawn from utility: Calamities are good both in their Original and End. Their Original is from God; who being eternally and immutably good, cannot be the cauſe of any Evil.

      * CHAP. VII. The end of Calamities alwayes directed to good; though often adminiſtred by wicked Men, and for their evil ends. The force of them is broken and allay'd by God. All things are guided to our advantage. VVhy God uſes wicked Men as his Inſtruments therein.

      * CHAP. VIII. More diſtinctly of the Ends themſelves. They are Three-fold; and to whom each belongs. Of the firſt End, vvhich is for the exerciſe of the Good. It is advantageous three wayes. It ſtrengthens them; tryes them, and fits them to be exemplary to others.

      * CHAP. IX. Of Chaſtiſement, the Second End. That it avails us two wayes.

      * CHAP. X. Of puniſhment the Third End; that it is good both in reſpect of God, Men, and him that is puniſhed.

      * CHAP. XI. Of a fourth End; which pertains either to the Conſervation and defence of the Vniverſe, or its Ornament. The Explication of each.

      * CHAP. XII. An old and common objection againſt the Divine Juſtice; why puniſhments are unequal. Its inquiſition remov'd from Man; and therefore unlawful.

      * CHAP. XIII. Yet to ſatisfie the curious, three uſual Objections are anſwered: Firſt, of that; that evil Men are not puniſhed. To which is reply'd; that though their puniſhments are deferred, they are not remitted. And this comes to paſs either for Mans ſake, or from the Nature of God which is ſlow to Revenge.

      * CHAP. XIV. That there are divers ſorts of puniſhments; ſome occult and internal, which accompany the crime it ſelf; and which the wicked never eſcape. That ſuch are more grievous than any external ones.

      * CHAP. XV. That puniſhments after Death do await the wicked, and that for the moſt part they are not acquitted from External ones, is proved by examples.

      * CHAP. XVI. The Second Objection anſwered, that all have deſerved puniſhment; in regard all have offended: That Men cannot judge who is more or leſs culpable. 'Tis God only that clearly diſcerns betwixt crimes, and therefore moſt juſtly puniſhes.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Third Objection; that puniſhments are transferred, anſwered. That Men do the ſame; why God doth ſo?

      * CHAP. XVIII. A tranſition to the laſt Argument for Conſtancy, from Examples. That ſometimes it is adviſeable to mix harſher Phyſick with ſuch things as are pleaſant.

      * CHAP. XIX. That publick Evils are not ſo great as they ſeem, proved firſt by Reaſon. That we fear the circumſtance and dreſs of things rather than themſelves.

      * CHAP. XX. A Second proof by way of Compariſon. But firſt the Calamities of the Belgians, and of the Age heightned. That common Opinion refuted. And proved that the Nature of Man is prone to aggravate our own Afflictions.

      * CHAP. XXI. A more ſtrict confutation of it, by comparing the preſent Evils, with thoſe of former times. Firſt, of Warrs, of the wonderfull ſlaughter of the Jews.

      * CHAP. XXII. Of the Calamities of the Graecians and Romans too occaſioned by Warr. the vaſt number of Men ſlain by ſome particular Commanders. The Deſolations of the new found world, and the miſeries of captivity.

      * CHAP. XXIII. Wonderful examples of Plagues and Famines in Former times. Alſo of exceſſive Taxes and Rapines heretofore.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Arehearſall of ſome ſtrange Cruelties and murthers in time paſt, above the guilt of this Age.

      * CHAP. XXV. Of the preſent Tyranny. That it is from humane Nature or Malice. Oppreſſions external and internal were heretofore.

      * CHAP. XXVI. Laſtly, that theſe evils are neither ſtrange nor new. But common to all Nations and Men; whence we may derive comfort.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The concluſion of the whole diſcourſe, and a ſhort exhortation to conſider ſeriouſly of it.
