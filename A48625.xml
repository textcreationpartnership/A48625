            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Not that you cannot converſe with <hi>Lipſius</hi> when you pleaſe, without the help of an Interpreter: Nor that I pretend by ſo ſlight a preſent as this, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with him; who
<pb facs="tcp:101013:4"/>ha's ever been ready to perform me all the beſt Offices that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a generous and diſintereſted friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. But, to ſpeak truth, I have done it in a kind of tenderneſs to my ſelf: I know you will look upon my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing your name to this Eſſay with other Eyes than ſome others would; and will interpret that to be the Fruit of a well-meaning affection; which perhaps they
<pb facs="tcp:101013:4"/>would have called the bold effects of an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable preſumption. Being alſo conſcious to my ſelf, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I have humbled that mighty Genius, which moves it ſelf (with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and happy ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy as well as reaſon) throughout almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry page of our Authour, by the cheap and baſe allay I have brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: I determined to appeaſe his Manes, and make him ſome amends
<pb facs="tcp:101013:5"/>at leaſt by the choice of ſuch a patronage as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly himſelf would not have refuſed: I am ſure I do not flatter you, when I ſay you are none of thoſe degenerate <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> whom <hi>Gildas</hi> their own Country-man calls <hi>aetatis atramentum;</hi> but ſuch a one as <hi>Lipſius</hi> himſelf doth elſe wheredeſcribe.

            <p>THeſe Books of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which I both began and finiſhed in the midſt of the troubles of my Country, I thought meet to dedicate, and devote to you; the great Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of ſo great a City.

<pb facs="tcp:101013:7"/>yours which I have often expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, and which is peculiar to you; towards all that are good and learned. You will not I ſuppoſe diſdain the gift; which though ſmall in it ſelf, will derive a kind of value from the mind of the Donour: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have given you the very beſt, and greateſt of ſuch things, as my Scholaſtical ſtores would at this time afford. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, poſsibly the novelty of it may ſome way recommend it. For (if I am not miſtaken) I am the firſt, who have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the opening, and clearing of
<pb facs="tcp:101013:7"/>this way of Wiſdom, ſo long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and overgrown with thorns; which certainly is ſuch, as (in conjunction with the holy Scriptures) will lead us to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, and peace. For my own part, I wanted not a deſire, to render my thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to you; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the profit of others; if I have not had the ability, it is but reaſonable, that you ſhould be as equal to me, as I am to the great God; who I know hath not given all things to any one.

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am not ignorant of thoſe new judgments and cenſures I am likely to undergo in this new way of writing: Partly, from ſuch as will be ſurprized with the unexpected pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of wiſdom from him, whom they believed had only been converſant in the more pleaſing and delightful ſtudies; and partly from ſuch as will deſpiſe and undervalue all that can be ſaid in theſe matters, after what the ancients have written. To both theſe; it is for my concern, and no leſs for thine, that I ſhould briefly reply. The firſt ſort of perſons ſeem to me to miſcarry in two moſt different reſpects: in their care, and their careleſneſs. In the former that they aſſume to themſelves a liberty of enquiring into the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſtudies of others: in the latter, that their enquiries are yet ſo overly and ſuperficial For (that I may give them an account of me) the Hills and Springs of the Muſes did never ſo
<pb facs="tcp:101013:9"/>intirely poſſeſs me; as that I ſhould not find fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent opportunities to turn back my Eyes and Mind upon that ſeverer deity: I mean Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy. The ſtudies of which (even from my Childhood) were ſo pleaſing to me, that in this youthful kind of ardour I ſeemed to offend, and to ſtand in need of the bridle of reſtraint. My Tutors at <hi>Ubich</hi> know how all thoſe kind of books, were as it were forced out of my hands together with thoſe writings and commentaries which I had laboriouſly compoſed out of all the beſt ranks of interpreters. Nor certainly did I afterward degenerate; for I know that in all the courſe of my ſtudies; if not in an exact and ſtraight line, yet at leaſt in the flexure, I have tended towards this mark of wiſdom. Not after the rate of moſt here that deal in Philoſophy: who doting upon ſome thorny ſubtilties, or ſnares of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, do nothing elſe but weave and unweave them with a kind of ſubtile thread of diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They reſt in words, and ſome little falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and wear away their dayes in the Porch of Philoſophy, but never viſit its more retired apartments. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ey uſe it as a divertiſement, not as a remedy, and turn the moſt ſerious inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, into a ſportage with trifles: Who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them ſeeks after the improvement of his manners, the moderation of his affections; or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns a juſt end and meaſure for his fears or hopes.
<pb facs="tcp:101013:9"/>Yes, they ſuppoſe that wiſdome is ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in theſe things, that they think they do nothing, or nothing to the purpoſe that look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, And therefore if you conſider of their life, and ſentiments, amongſt the vulgar them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves you ſhall find nothing more foul than the one, nor more fooliſh than the other. For as wine (though nothing is more wholſome) is yet to ſome no better than poyſon: So is Phyloſophy to them that abuſe it. But my Mind was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; who alwayes ſteering my Ship, from theſe quick ſands of ſubtilties, have directed all my endeavours to attain that one Haven of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and quiet mind. Of which ſtudy of mine; I mean theſe books as the firſt and undeceivable inſtance. But ſay ſome others, theſe things have been more fully and better treated of by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. As to ſome of them I confeſs it: As to all I deny it. Should I write any thing of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or the affections after <hi>Seneca</hi> and the divine <hi>Epictetus:</hi> I ſhould have (my ſelf being judge) as little diſcretion as modeſty: But if ſuch things as they have not ſo much as touched upon, nor any other of the ancients (for I dare confidently affirm it) then why do they deſpiſe it, or why do they carp at it? I have ſought out conſolations againſt publick evils: Who has done it before me? Whether they look upon the matter, or the method; they muſt confeſs they are indebted to
<pb facs="tcp:101013:10"/>me for both: And for the words themſelves (let me ſay it) we have no ſuch penury, as to oblige us to become ſuppliants to any Man. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, let them underſtand I have written many other things for others; but this book chiefly for my ſelf; the former for fame, but this for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. That which one heretofore ſaid bravely and acutely; the ſame I now truly proclaim. To me a few Readers are enough, one is enough, none is enough. All that I deſire is, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever opens this book, may bring with him a diſpoſition to profit, and alſo to pardon. That if poſſibly have any where ſlipt (eſpecially when I endeavour to climb thoſe ſteep places of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Juſtice and Fate) they would pardon me. For certainly, I have no where erredout of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and obſtinacy: But rather through humane ignorance and infirmity. To conclude, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be informed by them, and I promiſe that no Man ſhall be ſo ready to convince; as I to correct. The other frailties of my nature, I neither diſſemble nor extenuate; but obſtinacy and the ſtudy of contention, I do heartily pray I may never be guilty of, and I do deteſt it. God ſend thee good health, my Reader; which I wiſh may be in part to thee through this book.</p>

After I had ſpoken many things vvith equal Freedom and Truth, concerning the troubles of <hi>Belgia:</hi> I told him at laſt, that howſoever I had pretended an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; yet this vvas the very Reaſon of my departure. For vvho, O <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> ſaid I, is there to be found of ſo flinty and hard a heart; as longer to endure theſe evils? We are toſs'd as you ſee, for ſo many Years together in the ſtormes of a Civil War: and are vvhirl'd up and down in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous Sea vvith the different Winds of Trouble and Sedition. Doth my temper incline me to eaſe and quiet?
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101013:12"/>The hoarce accents of Trumpets, and the claſhings of Armes, do ſpeedily interrupt me. Do I ſeek my Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements in the Country or Gardens? The Souldier and Swaſh-buckler ſoon fright me into the City. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O <hi>Langius,</hi> leaving this infeſted and unfortunate <hi>Belgia</hi> (pardon me O thou Genius of my Country) I am reſolv'd (as he ſaies) to ſhift my Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation; and to fly into any part of the Earth, where I may neither hear of the name or actions of this Race of <hi>Pelops.

Either from you or moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly from this Life, reply'd I. For what Sanctuary is there from theſe Evils, but only in the flight of them? For to behold them and endure them daily I am not able <hi>Langius,</hi> as being one whoſe heart you may be ſure is not compoſed of Adamant. <hi>Langius</hi> ſigh'd at this diſcourſe; and feeble
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101013:12"/>Young Man ſaid he, what kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy is this? Or what may be thy meaning to ſeek for ſafety by flight?

                  <p>YEs I hear him, ſaid <hi>Langius,</hi> vvith a kind of Nod: but I had rather you would hear the Voice of Wiſdom and Reaſon. For thoſe Clouds and Miſts vvhich enwrap you <hi>Lipſius,</hi> are ingendered by the Vapours of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore in this Caſe (as <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſaies) you have more need of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101013:13"/>Reaſon than a Rope: I mean ſuch a ray as may enlighten the darkneſs of your underſtanding. You are about to leave your Country, but tell me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, vvhen you forſake it, can you alſo forſake your ſelf? Take heed leſt you experience the contrary; and carry with you even in that boſome of yours, the ſource and fountain of all your evils. As thoſe who are ſick of a Feaver do continually toſs and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſhift their Beds, with a vain hope of finding ſome eaſe thereby: In the ſame manner it is vvith us, who do in vain paſs from one Climate to another; vvhile the ſickneſs is in our Minds. For this is to manifeſt, not to remove the diſeaſe: to make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of this Internal heat; but not at all to aſſwage it. The wiſe Roman ſpeaks excellently vvell. 'Tis the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the ſick not to endure any thing long: and to make uſe of change it ſelf, inſtead of a Remedy. Hence are thoſe ſtraggling peregrinations, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101013:14"/>thoſe wandring Voyages upon the Shores undertaken: Now by Land, and anon by Sea; vvith a levity that is ever diſguſted vvith vvhatſoever is preſent. You do therefore rather fly than eſcape troubles, after the manner of that Hind in <hi>Virgil</hi>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101013:14"/>but rather carry it elſewhere. He that ha's broke an Arm or Leg does not uſe to call for a Horſe or Coach, but for a Chirurgion: What kind of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie then is that of yours; that cauſes you to ſeek the Cure of an inward vvound, by motion and gadding up and down? For certainly it is the mind vvhich is ſick; and all this outward vveakneſs, deſpair and langour, ariſes from this one Fountain, that it lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes and is caſt down. That Princely and Diviner part hath caſt away the Scepter; and hath humbled it ſelf to that Degree of baſeneſs; as to become a voluntary ſlave to its own Vaſſailes.</p>
                  <p>Tell me now in this Caſe; vvhat advantage is to be hop'd for, from Place or Motion? Unleſs poſſibly there is any ſuch Region, vvhich can tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per our Feats, or bridle our hopes; or make us diſcharge our ſelves again of that filthy matter of Vices, vvhich we have ſo liberally taken down. But
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101013:15"/>there is alaſs no ſuch, no not in the Fortunate Iſlands themſelves; or if there be, be ſo kind as to ſhew us it, and vve vvill all embody and fort vvith march thither. You vvill ſay that very Motion, and change of place it ſelf hath that force; and that thoſe daily ſights, that variety of Cuſtomes men and places, vvhich vve meet vvith in travell; doth recreate and rouſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the dejected Mind.</p>
                  <p>You are deceiv'd <hi>Lipſius,</hi> for (to ſpeak ſeriouſly and as the matter doth require) I do not ſo far forth depreſs travail as to grant it no kind of povver over Man, and his Affections. Yes, let it be yielded that it hath, but hitherto only, that it may poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ſome lighter taedium; or as it vvere loathings of the Mind: but as for the Diſeaſes of it, they have lodg'd themſelves ſo deep therein, as to mock the Virtues of any external Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. Muſick, Wine, Sleep have frequently cur'd thoſe firſt and leſſer
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101013:15"/>Motions of Anger, Grief, or Love: But never the Diſeaſe, vvhen once it hath been fix'd and hath faſtned its Roots deep. The caſe is the ſame here; Travail vvill poſſibly heal ſome lighter languors, but it can never cure the true ones. For thoſe Firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vvhich do ariſe from the Body, do after a ſort ſtill remain in the Body; or at moſt (if I may ſay ſo) in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cies of the Mind: and therefore it is no marvail, if ſome leſſer ſpunge be able to vvipe them out. But it is not ſo vvith thoſe inveterate Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; vvhich have their Seat, yea throne in the very Soul of the Mind. When therefore you have gone far, and ſpent much time in travail, vvhen you have circled both Sea and Land: Yet no Seas vvill ſuffice to vvaſh them out, nor any Earth to overvvhelme them. They vvill follovv you, and vvhether on Foot or on Horſe-back, that I may uſe the Phraſe of the Poet; theſe black cares vvill ſit behind you.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101013:16"/>When <hi>Socrates</hi> vvas ask'd by one vvhat might be the Reaſon that he had no better accompliſh'd himſelf by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail: he anſwer'd him pertinently; becauſe ſaid he you did not travail from your ſelf. Somewhat like unto this I ſhall now ſay. Even vvhitherſoever you ſhall betake your ſelf; you vvill have in your company a corrupted and a corrupting Mind; none of the moſt deſireable aſſociates. I wiſh it an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate only, but I fear it may prove a leader: For your Affections vvill not ſo much follow you; as they vvill dragg you after them.</p>

                  <p>YOu vvill ſay then: doth not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail call us away from thoſe tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er evils? vvill not the proſpect of Fields, Rivers, and Mountains place us beyond the ſenſe of our Grief? They may poſſibly call you off; and place you beyond: but neither for any time nor vvith any firmneſs. As the eye is not long delighted with a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture how excellent ſoever: So all that varietie of Men and places, may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect us vvith the Novelty; but it vvill not laſt long. This is indeed a kind of vvandring from Evils; but not the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101013:17"/>flight of them: Nor is it in the power of travail to break; all it can do is to lengthen, this Chain of our Griefs. What advantage is it to me for a vvhile to behold the Light, and then forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith to paſs into ſome comfortleſs Dungeon? Such is the caſe; and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the vvhole Body of theſe outward pleaſures do lie in ambuſh for the Soul; and hurt us the more ſecurely, vvhile they pretend to aſſiſt us. As the vveaker ſort of Medicines do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exaſperate than draw forth the peccant humour: So this vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencie doth encreaſe and ſvvell the Tide of theſe deſires in us. For the Mind doth not long vvander from it ſelf; but by and by how unvvilling ſoever is compell'd to return home, unto its old familiatitie vvith Evils. Thoſe very Cities and Mountains vvhich you go to ſee; vvill reduce to your thoughts the Memory of your Country: And in the midſt of all your delights; you vvill either ſee or hear
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101013:17"/>of ſomething, vvhich vvill uncloſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the vvounds of your Griefes: Or if poſſibly you may reſt avvhile; it vvill prove but like to one of thoſe ſhorter ſlumbers; that leave the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaked party, in the ſame or a greater Feaver. For there are a ſort of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires which being interrupted do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the more: And are ſenſibly the ſtronger for having had Vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Away then <hi>Lipſius</hi> vvith theſe vain yea dangerous experiments; more like to poyſons than remedies: And betake your ſelf to thoſe, vvhich how ſevere ſoever, are yet the true ones. Are you about to change your Soile and Climb? O rather let it be your Mind: vvhich you have unhappily withdrawn from the Obedience of Right Reaſon: for no other purpoſe than to make it a Slave to your Affections. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound temper of that is the Root of this deſpair; and thence are your languors becauſe that is corrupted.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101013:18"/>It behoves you then rather to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a change of that, than of the place; and to ſtrive not ſo much to be elſe where, as to be another. You long now to ſee the fruitfull <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the Loyal and Stout <hi>Vienna,</hi> that King of Rivers the <hi>Danubius,</hi> and thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rare and ſtrange things vvhich Men ſo delightfully liſten to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of.</p>
                  <p>But hovv much better were it for you, if you had the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and eagerneſs after Wiſdome? If you vvould foot it in thoſe fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Fields; if you would ſearch out the ſprings of Humane perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; in fine, if you vvould erect ſuch Bulvvarks and Forts; as might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you impregnable to all the ſtorms and aſſaults of ſuch deſires as are Illegitimate? For theſe are the grand Remedies for your Diſeaſe; and every thing beſides are but as Lint and Lavatory. Your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vvill nothing help you; It vvill

For thoſe Pervicacious Perſons though they are not (ſwollen as they are) eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be depreſs'd: Yet a light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth lift them up. Not unlike unto a bladder vvhich being fill'd vvith vvind vvill not ſink vvithout difficulty; but appears aloft, and bounds upon the Water of its own accord. Such is the flatulent hardneſs of theſe Men; vvhich as I ſaid ariſes from Pride, and too high an eſtimate of ſelf, and by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101013:20"/>conſequence from Opinion. But the true Mother of Conſtancy, is Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and lowlineſs of the Mind; vvhich I define; A VOLUNTARY AND COMPLAINTLESSE EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DURANCE OF ALL THOSE THINGS WHATSOEVER THEY BE, THAT FALL OUT TO, OR FALL UPON A MAN FROM ELSEWHERE. Which being taken up, upon the actount of right Reaſon, is that only Root, from vvhence the height of this excellent Oak-like ſtrength doth vvear it ſelf. For here alſo it is requiſite that you ſhould be heedfull, leſt Opinion ſhould impoſe upon you, vvhich fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the room of Patience doth ſubrogate a kind of abject and ſtupid remper of the Mind; a very Vice, and vvhich ariſes from too low an eſtimate of our ſelves. As for Virtue ſhe ever marches in the middle path, and is cautiouſly heedfull leſt there ſhould be any thing of Exceſs or Defect in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101013:21"/>any of her Actions. For ſtill ſhe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects her ſelf by the Ballance of right Reaſon, and hath that alone for the rule and ſquare of her Teſt. Now this right Reaſon is nothing elſe but, A TRUE APPREHENSION AND JUDGEMENT OF HU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANE AND DIVINE MAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS, AS FARR AS THEY APPERTAIN TO US: Contrary hereunto is Opinion vvhich is A FU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TILE AND FALLACIOUS JUDGEMENT CONCERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING THE SAME THINGS.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. <hi>The Originals of Reaſon and Opinion. The Power and Effects of each. That leads to Conſtancy; this to Levity.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BUt foraſmuch as from this double ſpring (I mean of Reaſon and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) doth ariſe not only the ſtrength or vveakneſs of the Mind: But alſo every of thoſe things for vvhich vve are accounted praiſe-worthy, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable amongſt Men: I ſuppoſe I ſhall not do amiſs, if I go about a little more copiouſly to Diſcourſe of the Original and Nature of them both. For as Wools muſt have a previous tincture and preparation by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juices; before they are capable of receiving as they ſhould that laſt and more excellent colour they are intended for: After the ſame manner, <hi>Lipſius,</hi> your Mind is to be prepared
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101013:22"/>by a preceding Diſcourſe; before I ſhall be able (as I vvould) to dye it in the laſt purple of Conſtancy. There are therefore (as you vvell know) two parts in Man, Soul and Body: the one more Noble as reſembling Spirit and Office; the other is more Baſe as it reſpects the earth: Theſe two are joyn'd together, yet vvith a kind of diſagreeing Concord, nor do they eaſily accord vvith one another, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe matters wherein Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, or ſubſerviency is concern'd. For both have a deſire to ſway; but that eſpecially that ought not. Earth ſtrives to advance it ſelf above its own fire; and Clodds are ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to get above the Clouds. From hence are thoſe broils and troubles in a Man; and as it vvere a continual fight, betwixt two parties that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvayes Skirmiſhing vvith each other. The chief Leaders, and as it vvere Generalls unto theſe are Reaſon and Opinion. The one is for the Soul
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101013:22"/>and Warres therein; the other is for the Body, and in the Body it fights. Reaſon derives its Pedigree from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yea from God himſelf, and very highly doth <hi>Seneca</hi> extoll it, as a part of the Divine Spirit infuſed into Man. For this is that moſt excellent faculty of underſtanding and judging, vvhich is no leſs the perfection of the Soul, than the Soul it ſelf is the perfection of the Man. The Greeks call it the Mind, and ſo the Latines, or elſe the Mind of the Soul. For (that you be not miſtaken) the vvhole Soul is not right Reaſon; but that only therein vvhich is ſimple, Uniform, unmixed, ſever'd from all Lees and Dreggs, and (in a vvord) that vvhich is in it of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and coeleſtial. For the Soul it ſelf (howſoever it is lamentably cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and infected, vvith the ſtain of the Body, and the contagion of the Senſes) doth yet invvardly retain ſome certain Footſteps of its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: and there are in it (very clearly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101013:23"/>diſcernible) ſome ſparkling remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of that firſt and purer fire. Hence are thoſe ſtings of Conſcience even in the vvorſt and moſt profligate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Hence are thoſe invvard ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and gnawings; and hence is that approbation of a better Life, vvhich is frequently extorted from them, though not vvithout a reluctancy in themſelves. For that ſound and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer part vvithin us, may poſſibly for a time be ſuppreſſed, oppreſſed it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. And that burning Flame may be cover'd; but cannot be extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For thoſe little Fires do alwayes ſhine forth, and ſparkle out, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten us amongſt theſe ſhades, cleanſe us from theſe ſtains; guide us in our vvandrings; and to ſhew us the vvay to Conſtancy and Virtue. As the <hi>Heliotrope</hi> and ſome other Flowers do by a natural inſtinct bend towards the Sun: So doth Reaſon turn it ſelf to God and the Original of its ſelf. Firm and immoveable in vvhat is good,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101013:23"/>one and the ſame in its Cenſures; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſiring or flying one and the ſame thing, the very ſource and Fountain of right Councel and ſound Judgement. To obey this is no leſs than to command, and to be ſubject here is to ſvvay the Scepter of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe. Who ever hearkens unto this hath already ſubjugated the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious deſires and motions of the Mind: And he ſhall never be wildred in the Labyrinths of this Life, vvho remits himſelf to the guideance of this <hi>Theſeian</hi> Clevv. God himſelf by this his Image comes unto us (nay vvhich is yet more) into us. But that baſer and unſounder part (I mean Opinion) it owes its Original to the Body (that is to ſay) to Earth, and therefore ſavours nothing beſides it. For the Body howſoever it is immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſenſeleſs of it ſelf; yet it derives both Life and Motion from the Soul; and on the other ſide preſents to the Soul, the Images of things
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101013:24"/>through the Windowes of the ſenſes. Thus there is a kind of Communion and Society Cemented betwixt the Soul and the Body: but ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as if vve attend the Event, proves unfortunate to the Soul. For through this it is that the Soul, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſenſible degrees, is led from the Nobler place of its reſidence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes addicted to and is mingled vvith the Senſes, and from this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure mixture, is the birth of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; vvhich is no other than a vain ſhaddow, and reſemblance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The true ſeat of it is Senſe, the Parent, Earth; and therefore abject and baſe as it is, it advances not it ſelf, it aſpires not, nor ſo much as regards any thing that is lofty and Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therial. It is ever vain, uncertain, deceitfull, ill-adviſing, and as perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly judging: and that vvhich it chiefly aimes at, is at once to deprive the Soul of Conſtancy and Truth. It languiſhes for this thing to day, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101013:24"/>on the Morrow deſpiſes it, this it approves and this it condemnes; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vvith judgement, but gratifying the Body and indulging the Senſes in every thing. As the Eye makes but a falſe meaſure of thoſe things vvhich it beholds through ſome Cloud or in the Water: So doth the Mind but perverſly judge of vvhat it beholds through the miſty Mediums of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. This (if you conſider vvell) is to Man the Mother of his Evils; and this is the Author of that confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and perturbed Life vvithin us. That cares do diſquiet us, it is from hence; that the Paſſions do diſtract us, it is from hence; and if Vices do Reign over us, it is alſo from hence. And therefore as thoſe vvho are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to aboliſh Tyranny in any City; do firſt of all demoliſh the Caſtle: So if vve are Serious in the proſecution of a good Mind, vve muſt ſubvert this Citadel of Opinions. For vve ſhall fluctuate vvith them for ever: Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101013:25"/>Plaintfull, Diſcompos'd, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (as vve ought) aſſigning vvhat is equall either to God or Man. As a void and empty Ship, is toſſed in the Sea, vvith every wind: So vvill that Vagrant Mind of ours be, vvhich the vveight, and (as it vvere) the ballaſt of Reaſon hath not eſtabliſhed.</p>

This is that only <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena</hi> vvhich can preſent you vvith that true and rich <hi>Nepenthe,</hi> in vvhich you may drown the memory of all your Cares and Griefs; which if once you have taſted and taken down; proof againſt every chance, in the ſame equal tenour, and not vvavering after the manner of a ballance; you may challenge to your ſelf that great and God-like property of Immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

It ſhall be yours; vvho being truly a King, and truly free; ſhall be a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto God alone, exempt from the bondage both of Affections and Fortune. As there are ſome certain Rivers which are ſaid to paſs through the middle of Seas; and yet preſerve themſelves intire: ſo you ſhall travel through ſurrounding tumults in ſuch a

                  <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>VVhat it is and how manifold, that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Conſtancy: they are external good and evil things. Thoſe evils are twofold, Publick and Private; thoſe which are Publick ſeem the moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and dangerous.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WHen <hi>Langius</hi> had ſpoken theſe things vvith a Voice and Air more earneſt than he uſed: a ſpark of this deſirable fire did ſeiſe on me alſo. And my Father ſaid I (for I call you truly not feignedly ſo) lead me where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you pleaſe, and inſtruct, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and direct me. You have a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient prepared for any method of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration vvhether you ſhall determine to make uſe of the Cauſtick, or ſhall proceed to Amputation. Both theſe reply'd <hi>Langius,</hi> in as much as in ſome places the ſtubble of idle Opinions
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101013:27"/>is to be ſet on ſire, and elſewhere the ſhrubs of Paſſions are to be grubb'd up by the very Roots. But ſhall vve continue our vvalk; or whether is it not better and moſt convenient for us to ſit? To ſit reply'd I, for I begin to be hot, and that upon divers accounts: So aſſoon as <hi>Langius</hi> had caus'd Chairs to be brought into the ſame Court, and that vve vvere both ſate; turning himſelf towards me, he again thus began.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto <hi>Lipſius</hi> I have been laying the Foundations vvhereupon I might ſafely erect my diſcourſe: Now if you vvill I ſhall draw a little nearer to you, enquire out the cauſes of your Grief, and as they ſay, lay my Finger upon the very ſore. There are two things that lay Battery to this fort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy vvithin us. Falſe Goods and falſe Ills. Both vvhich I thus define. THINGS NOT WITHIN BUT ABOUT US and WHICH PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERLY DO NEITHER DAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AGE
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101013:27"/>NOR ADVANTAGE THIS OUR INWARD MAN THAT IS OUR SOUL. And therefore I vvill not call them Good or Evil; as if they were ſo abſolutely and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: But only from Opinion and the common miſtake of the Vulgar. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Firſt they Ranke Riches, Honours, Power, Health, Long-life. Amongſt the Laſt Poverty, Infamy, vvant of Power, Diſeaſes and Deaths; and in a vvord vvhatſoever is acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and external. From theſe two ſtocks thoſe four chief Affections grow up in us vvhich compaſs and perplex the vvhole life of Man. Deſire and Joy, Fear and Grief. The two former of theſe reſpect ſome imagined good; and thence are bred: the two laſt reſpect ſuppoſed evils. Each of them do equally hurt and moleſt the Mind: and unleſs care be taken to dethrone it; though not after one and the ſame manner. For vvhereas the repoſe and Conſtancy of the Mind is placed in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101013:28"/>a kind of even and equall ballance; they force it from this poiſe, the one by hoiſting, and the other by depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it. But theſe falſe goods together vvith the Elation of the Mind by them, I ſhall purpoſely paſs over (as not concerning your Diſeaſe) and haſten to thoſe I call falſe evils; The Brigade of vvhich is alſo twofold; Publick and Private. The Publick I thus define; SUCH AS THE SENSE OF WHICH, DOTH AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME EXTEND TO MANY. The Private; SUCH AS REACH BUT TO SINGLE PERSONS. Amongſt the former I reckon Warrs, Peſtilence, Famine, Tyranny, Slaught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſuch other things as ſpread abroad; and do reſpect the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Amongſt the latter I put Grief, Poverty, Diſgrace, Death; and what ever is enclos'd within private vvalls, and is the concernment of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon. It is not upon any
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101013:28"/>frivolous account that I thus diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. Foraſmuch, as indeed that Man mourns otherwiſe and in a different Faſhion vvho laments the Calamity of his Country, the Exile and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of many; than he vvho only ſighs for his own misfortunes. Add to this, that from each of theſe do ariſe different Diſtempers, and if I miſtake not, the more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and durable from the former. For moſt of us are concern'd in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Calamities; vvhether it is that they ruſh upon us vvith an impetuous vehemence: Or as it vvere in a form'd Battalia do overwhelm the Oppoſer, or rather that they flatter us vvith a kind of Ambition, that keeps us ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and inſenſible, that through them a ſickneſs is bred in our Minds. For vvhoever he is that bows under a private Grief, he muſt of neceſſity acknowledge his vice and vveakneſs; although he amend it not, for vvhat excuſe hath he? But he vvho falls
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101013:29"/>under this other; ſo farr is he many times from the acknowledgement of his fall and fault, that he often makes it his boaſt, and eſteems it a praiſe-worthy thing. For it is ſtyl'd Piety and Commiſeration, and there vvants but little; that this publick Feaver is not conſecrated not only amongſt the Virtues; but the very Deities them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Poets and Oratours do everyvvhere extoll and inculcate the fervent Love of our Country: Nor do I my ſelf deſire altogether to eraſe it, but to temper and moderate it; this is all that I contend for. For aſſuredly it is a very vice, a Diſeaſe, the very fall of the Mind, and the caſting of it down from its ſeat. But vvithall on the other ſide, it is a very grievous Diſeaſe, inaſmuch as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is not a ſingle Grief only, but your own and anothers confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that other is alſo double, reſpecting the Men, or the Country.</p>
                  <p>That you may the better apprehend
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101013:29"/>what I have more obſcurely deliver'd take this inſtance. You ſee your <hi>Belgia</hi> is at this time preſs'd vvith more than a ſingle Calamity; the Flames of this Civil vvar doth enwrap it on every ſide: You ſee on all hands that Fields are vvaſted and ſpoiled, Towns are burnt and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned; men are taken and ſlain; Vla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons are defiled; Virgins raviſhed, and vvhatſoever in humanities uſe to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany vvarr. Is not here matter of Grief to you? Grief indeed; but a various and divided one (if you conſider it vvell; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as at one and the ſame time, you lament your ſelf, and your Countrymen, and your Country beſides. In your ſelf your loſſes, in your Countrymen their various Fortune and Death, in your Country, the change and overthrow of its State. Here you have cauſe to cry out; O miſerable man that I am! there

We have often ſeen the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks tremble and throng together unto the Temples, upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of ſome ſudden and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Calamity; but ſo ſoon as it is over, call aſide thoſe very men; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them apart, and you vvill find that each of theſe vvas in fear only for his Corn, and ſome little Cloſe of his own. Let them cry Fire, Fire, in this City, and I may almoſt affirm that the very Blind and the Lame vvill run to quench it. But vvhat think you? Is it for the Love of their Country? Inquire of themſelves I pray, and the anſwer vvill be becauſe the loſs, or at leaſt the fear of it doth extend to every Man in particular. It is in this caſe, after the very ſame manner: Publick evils do generally afflict and diſquiet Men; not becauſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101013:32"/>many are concern'd in thoſe loſſes: but becauſe themſelves are amongſt thoſe many.</p>

                  <p>BE you therefore the Judge, and let this cauſe be pleaded before your own Tribunal; only (as I ſaid before) let the diſguiſe be taken off. As thus. Do you indeed feare this Warre? You do feare it. Upon what account? Becauſe Peſtilence and Slaughter are the companions of Warre. To whom
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101013:33"/>comes that Peſtilence? To others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for the preſent, but it may alſo in time reach unto you. Behold there the true ſource of your Grief; and (if without the rack you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the truth) it hath no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. For as when the lightning hath ſtrook down ſome one; even thoſe alſo tremble who are near: ſo in thoſe great and Common Calamities, the loſſe arrives unto few; but the fear unto all. Now take but that away, and together with it this grief alſo is removed. If Warre be amongſt the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> or <hi>Indians,</hi> you are not mov'd at all (for you are in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) but if in <hi>Belgia,</hi> then you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and take on, and deliver up your ſelf to all the expreſſions of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. But if you bewaile Publick evills as ſuch; where lyes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? you will ſay that is not my Country. Thou Fool! Are not they alſo men? of the ſame ſtock and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal with they ſelf? under the ſame
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101013:33"/>Canopy of heaven; and on the ſame Globe of Earth? ſuppoſe you that this little Horizon which theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains terminate, and theſe Rivers bound, is your Country? you are miſtaken; It is the whole World, whereſoever there are men ſprung from that celeſtial ſeed. <hi>Socrates</hi> of old reply'd excellently to one that ask'd him of what Country he was: of the World ſaid he. For a great and lofty mind includes not it ſelf within the narrow limits of opinion: but in its apprehenſion and thought embraces this whole univerſe as its own. We have ſeen and derided the folly of ſuch; whoſe keepers have tyed them in a nooz of ſtravv only; or ſome ſlender thread: and yet they have ſtood as if they vvere ſhackl'd in fetters of iron: ſuch a kind of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is this of ours; vvho by the vain bond of opinion are reſtrain'd to a certain part of earth.

                     <hi>Langius</hi> ſmiling, and what ſaid he do you then expect at my hands, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers or Muſcadell? It is not long ſince you call'd for the ſharpeſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Chirurgery; And rightly, for you hear a Philoſopher <hi>Lipſius</hi> and not a Minſtrel; vvhoſe deſign is to teach, not to entertain, to profit, and not to pleaſe. I had rather you ſhould bluſh and be aſham'd, than laugh: and that you ſhould repent rather than triumph. The School of a Philoſopher, O yea Men (ſaid <hi>Rufus</hi> of old) is the ſhop of a phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, vvhereunto Men haſten for health and not for Divertiſement. This Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician neither flatters nor ſmooths up any, but pierces, tents, and ſearches the vvound, and vvith a kind of ſharp Salt of Speech, ſcoures away that Scurfe that cleaves to our Minds. And therefore <hi>Lipſius</hi> dream not (no not hereafter) of Roſes, Pulſe, and Poppyes, but of Thorns and Poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, of Worme-wood and Vinegar.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101013:36"/>But ſaid I <hi>Langius</hi> (if I may ſay it) you deal with me in an ill and malicious manner: Nor do you as a skilfull vvraſtler caſt me upon a right lock; but ſupplant me by a cheat. In a counterfeit manner (ſay you) vve la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our Country. Do I? It is not ſo. For to grant you this (as one that means ingemouſly) that I have therein a reſpect unto my ſelf, yet not unto my ſelf alone. For I do lament <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> I do lament my Country in the Firſt place, and I vvill lament it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the midſt of its hazzards, there ſhould be no danger to me. And that upon the juſteſt grounds, for this is ſhe vvhich hath entertain'd, foſter'd, and nouriſh'd me; and is according to the common ſence of Nations our moſt Reverend and Venerable Parent. But in the mean time you aſſign me the whole Univerſe as my Country. Who doubts it? But yet even your ſelf vvill confeſs, that beſides this vaſt and common one, I have another
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101013:36"/>more limited and peculiar Country; unto vvhich by a certain ſecret bond of Nature I have a nearer Obligation. Unleſs you do imagine that there is no force in our being ſwath'd and ſuckl'd in that our Native ſoil, vvhich vve have firſt greeted vvith this Body of ours; and firſt ſet foot upon, vvhoſe Air vve have breath'd; in which our Infancy hath cri'd, our Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood play'd, and in vvhich our youth hath been educated and trained up. Where the Skies and Rivers, and Fields are familiar with our eyes: wherein in a continued order, are our Kindred and Friends, and Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates: and ſo many other invitations unto Joy; as vve in vain hope to meet vvith in any other place of the Earth. Nor are theſe tyes (as you ſeem to aſſert) from the ſlender threads of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, but from the ſtrong Chains of Nature it ſelf. Go to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves and behold the vvild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt among them do love and own the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101013:37"/>places vvhere they lodge, and the Birds their Neſts. The very Fiſhes themſelves, in that vaſt and boundleſs Ocean, do yet delight in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome certain part of it. For what ſhould I ſpeak of Men? Who vvhether they are civiliz'd or ſtill in Barbariſme; are yet ſo glew'd to their Native Earth, that whoſoever is a Man will never doubt to dye for, and in it. And therefore <hi>Langius</hi> this new and rigid Wiſdom of yours, (for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) I neither embrace nor compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, I am rather the Diſciple of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides</hi> more truly affirming, that

                  <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>The Second Affection of too much Love to our Country refuted. That it is falſly call'd Piety. As alſo whence this Affection hath its Original. What is properly and truly our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>LAngius</hi> ſmiling at this diſcourſe; Young Man (ſaid he) your Piety is vvonderful, and now it concernes the Brother of <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> to look after his Sir-name. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it falls out vvell, that this Affection doth ſo readily preſent it ſelf and advance before its colours, vvhich I had before determin'd to charge and to overthrow with ſome light endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. But in the firſt place I muſt ſeize upon as ſpoil that very beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Garment wherewith it hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily attyr'd it ſelf: For this Love
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101013:38"/>unto our Country is commonly call'd Piety; vvhich for my part as I do not underſtand, ſo neither am I able to endure. For how comes it to be Piety? Which I acknowledge to be an excellent Virtue, and properly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but A LAWFUL, DUE, HONOUR AND LOVE TO GOD, AND OUR PARENTS. With vvhat Fore head now doth our Country ſeat it ſelf in the midſt of theſe? Becauſe ſay they it is that vvhich is our moſt Ancient and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Parent. Ah ſilly Souls! And herein injurious not only to Reaſon but alſo unto Nature it ſelf. Is that a Parent? Upon vvhat account, or in vvhat reſpect? For I profeſs I ſee not, if you <hi>Lipſius</hi> are any ſharper ſighted, help to enlighten me. Is it becauſe it hath entertain'd us (for that you ſeem'd to inſinuate but now) the like hath been done to us often by an Hoſt or Inkeeper. Hath it cheriſh'd us? So have our Nurſes, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101013:38"/>thoſe Women that, vvhen time vvas, bare us too and fro, vvith a farre greater tenderneſs. Hath it nouriſh'd us? This Office it performs daily to Beaſts and Trees, and all ſorts of Grain, and ſo do alſo thoſe great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes; Heaven, Air and VVater, as vvell as the Earth. To conclude, tranſport your ſelf, and any other ſoil vvill performe the ſame. Theſe are frothy light vvords, from vvhich nothing can be extracted beſides a certain vulgar and unprofitable juice of Opinion. Thoſe are indeed our Parents, vvho have conceiv'd, begot, and gone vvith us; to vvhom vve are ſeed of their ſeed, blood of their blood, and fleſh of their fleſh. Of all vvhich if there is any thing vvhich in any degree of compariſon, may be fitly ſpoken of our Country: I am willing that all my attempts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this kind of Piety, ſhould prove but loſt labour. But (ſay you) there are many learned and great Men, who
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101013:39"/>every vvhere have ſpoken after this faſhion. I acknowledge it, but it vvas then vvhen they had reſpect to Fame only, not to truth; vvhich if you vvill follow, you shall reſtore back that Sacred and Auguſt Name unto God; or (if you pleaſe) to your Parents, and command this Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (vvhen it is corrected) to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented vvith the honeſt name of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But thus far concerning the name only, let us now conſider the thing; vvhich truly I ſhall not vvholly remove, but moderate, and pare (as it vvere) vvith the Pen-knife of Right Reaſon. For as the Vine unleſs you prune it, vvill very vvidely extend it ſelf: So vvill thoſe Affections more eſpecially, vvhoſe Sails are ſwell'd vvith any guſt of popularity. And I readily confeſs to you <hi>Lipſius</hi> (for I have not ſo put off at once, both the Man and the Citizen) that there is in every one of us, a kind of inclination and Love to this leſſer country of ours:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101013:39"/>the cauſes and Original of vvhich I perceive are not ſo clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by you. For you vvill have it to be from Nature, vvhereas it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from a kind of uſage and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome. For after that Men from that rude and ſolitary life, vvere forc'd from the Fields into Towns, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to build Houſes and Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to grow into Societies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Bodies, to make or repell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions: From that time there did of neceſſity commence amongſt them, a kind of Communion and Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as to divers things. They toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſſeſs'd ſuch a part of Earth vvith ſuch and ſuch limits: They had their Temples, Market-places, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries and Courts of Judicature in Common; and (vvhich is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal bond) their Rites, Statutes, and Lawes. Which things yet our cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes, did ſo begin to love and care for (nor did it therein altogether erre) as its own peculiar. For there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101013:40"/>unto every particular Citizen, a true right as to thoſe things, nor do they farther differ from private poſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions than in this, that they are not the propriety of any Perſon alone. Now that Community doth expreſs (as it vvere) a kind of forme and face of a new State, vvhich vve call a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and the ſame thing (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) our Country. In vvhich vvhen Men did underſtand how much of moment there vvas in reference to the ſafety of every particular Perſon, there vvere then alſo Lawes made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the improvement and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it, or at leaſt a Cuſtome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from our Anceſtours, vvhich hath the force of a Law. Hence it comes to paſs, that vve rejoyce in its advantages, and grieve in its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities: Foraſmuch as in very deed our private ſubſtance is ſafe, in the ſafety of it, and periſhes in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtations of it. Hence is charity or Love towards it, vvhich our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101013:40"/>(upon the account of the publick good, vvhereunto alſo a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſecret providence of God doth attract us) have encreaſed, vvhile they endeavour'd in every of their vvords and deeds to advance the Majeſty of their Country. This Affection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in my Opinion is from Cuſtom, but if from Nature (as you did lately inſinuate) vvhat is the reaſon that it diffuſeth not it ſelf into all alike, and in equal meaſure? Why do the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and vvealthier ſort love and care for their Country more, and the vulgar and meaner ſort leſs? Whom you may behold (for the moſt part) full of their own cares vvith a palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neglect of the publick, vvhich yet doth moſt certainly fall out otherwiſe in every ſuch Affection as proceeds from the peremptory injunctions of Nature. To conclude, vvhat reaſon vvill you aſſigne why ſo light an occaſion ſhould oftentimes diminiſh or remove it? See how this man Revenge, a ſecond
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101013:41"/>Love, and others Ambition hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lur'd from their Country; and in our dayes how many hath the God <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in the ſame manner ſeduced? How many <hi>Italians</hi> are there, vvho quitting <hi>Italy</hi> the Queen of Countrys for gain alone have tranſported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into <hi>France, Germany,</hi> yea into <hi>Sarmatia</hi> and there fixed their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations? How many thouſand <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> doth Avarice and Ambition yearly draw into remote Lands and of a different Climate? Certainly a great and ſtrong proof, that this vvhole Obligation is but external and Opinionative; ſeeing ſome one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Luſt can vvith that facility diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve or break it. But you erre alſo to purpoſe <hi>Lipſius,</hi> in the bounding of that Country, for you reſtrain it to that Native ſoil of ours vvherein vve have ſettled, and whereupon we have walk'd, and ſuch other things as you tinckle with a vain ſound of Words. For you will ſeek in vain from thence
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101013:41"/>the Natural cauſes of this Love. For if only our Native ſoil may challenge that name, then only <hi>Bruxells</hi> is my Country, <hi>Iſca</hi> thine, a Cottage or a Hut vvill be ſome other Mans: Yes there are many that vvill not have ſo much as a Cottage for theirs, but muſt ſeek it in the Woods or open Fields. Shall then my love and care be ſhut up vvithin ſuch narrow li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits? Shall I embrace and defend this Village or that Houſe as my Country? You are ſenſible of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities; and Oh how happy (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your determination in theſe matters) are thoſe Wood-men and Ruſticks, vvhoſe Native ſoile is ever in its flouriſh, and almoſt beyond all the hazzards of Calamity or Ruine! But certainly that is not our Country; No, but (as I ſaid before) ſome one State, and as it vvere a common Ship under one Lord, or under one Law; VVhich if you vvill have (of right) to be beloved by its Natives; I ſhall
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101013:42"/>confeſs it: If to be defended I ſhall acknovvledge it, If death to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone for its ſake, I ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; but ſhall never yield to that that vve ſhould alſo grieve, be caſt dovvn, lament,

                  <p>THis Diſcourſe of <hi>Langius</hi> vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew (methought) a Cloud from my underſtanding; and, my Father (ſaid I) you ſtill better me both by your reproofs and inſtructions. So that (methinks) I am now able to keep under that Affection which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the place and ſtate in which, but not as yet that which reſpects the Men themſelves amongſt whom I have been bred. For how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the loſſes of my Country ſhould not touch and deeply affect me for my Country-mens and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions ſakes, vvho are toſs'd in the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101013:43"/>Ocean of theſe Calamities, or periſh by a different and unhappy Deſtiny. <hi>Langius</hi> interrupting me; but this <hi>Lipſius</hi> ſaid he is not properly Grief, but Pitty; which yet it ſelf is to be deſpis'd, by a wiſe and conſtant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For nothing is more ſuitable to ſuch a one than firmneſs and ſtrength of Mind, which cannot be, in caſe not only his own, but alſo anothers Calamity ſhall overturn and diſcompoſe him. Here I interrupted him, and vvhat Thornes of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks</hi> are theſe ſaid I? Do you forbid me to pitty too? Yet this is look'd upon as a Virtue by all good Men; at leaſt amongſt us vvho are ſeaſon'd vvith the true Religion and Piety. <hi>Langius</hi> immediately, but I ſaid he do forbid it, and if I ſhall remove this ſickneſs from the Minds of Men; there is no Man who is really good that vvill reſent it amiſs. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a ſickneſs, nor is he far diſtant from miſery, whoever he is that pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101013:44"/>one who is miſerable. As it is a ſigne of a vveak and bad Eye to grow Blood-ſhot at the ſight of one that is ſo: So is it of a vveak Mind to grieve at the ſight of one that grieves. Pitty is rightly defin'd, THE VICE OF A SLENDER AND MEAN MIND FAINTING AT THE APPEARANCE OF ANOTHERS MISFORTUNE. What then? Are vve ſo rigid and ſevere as not to ſuffer that any ſhould be mov'd or affected vvith the grief of another? Yes, to be affected I approve, but then it muſt be ſo as to aſſiſt, not ſo as to lament. I am for Mercy, but not for Pitty. For thus I am willing to diſtinguiſh at this time, and a while to recede from our Porch the better to inſtruct. I call Mercy AN IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLINATION OF THE MIND TO LIGHTEN THE PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERTY OR ANGUISH OF ANOTHER. This is that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue <hi>Lipſius</hi> vvhich you diſcover as it
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101013:44"/>vvere through a miſt, and in vvhich Pitty creeps to, and impoſes upon you. But you vvill ſay it is Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be affected vvith Pitty and compaſſion: Be it ſo; yet is it not therefore right. Suppoſe you that there is any Virtue in the Effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and ſtoopage of the Mind? In Sighs, or Sobbs, or in the mingling of broken and disjoynted vvords with a Mourner? You are miſtaken. If you think not, I can produce a ſort of covetous old Women and ſome ſordid <hi>Euclio's</hi> from whoſe Eyes it is much more eaſie to extract a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Tears, than one ſingle Penny from their Purſes. But now that truly mercifull Man (of vvhom I have been ſpeaking) he vvill not indeed be pittiful; but yet he vvill performe the ſame, or better Offices, than he that is ſo. He will behold other mens Evils with a humane, but yet with a right Eye. He will diſcourſe with the Sufferers, with a ſerious, but not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101013:45"/>vvith a mournfull or dejected Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. He vvill comfort couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, he will aſſiſt liberally, and vvill do more nobly, than he vvill ſpeak, and vvill more readily lend his hand than vvords to a neceſſitous or fallen Man. And all theſe things he vvill performe vvith Caution and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection; leſt as in ſome very miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Contagion; the Diſeaſe of another ſhould transferre it ſelf to him: Or leſt (as they ſay of Gladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atours) a vvound ſurprize him through anothers ſide. What is there here (I beſeech you) of ſevere and rigid? and ſuch is the whole Body of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, vvhich to them that look upon it at a diſtance, ſeems to be ſterne and lowring: But as many as make nearer approaches, it is found to be ſo gentle and complaiſant, as that the Goddeſs of Love her ſelf is not more amicable and obliging. But enough of theſe three Affections; vvhich I have partly put to the foyle

                  <p>I Come now at length from our Velitation to a true and ſerious fight, and laying aſide theſe light and jocular Armes, unto ſuch vvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons as ſhall finally decide the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I ſhall lead up my Souldiers and Forces in Order; and range them under their ſeveral Enſignes, vvhich
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101013:46"/>I alſo forme into Four Squadrons. The Firſt, ſhall evince that publick evils are ſent unto, and diſpers'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us by God himſelf. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that they are neceſſary, and from Fate. The Third, that they are advantageous to us. And the laſt, that they are neither over-preſſive nor new. Now if theſe Forces of mine ſhall, from their ſeveral Poſts, dextrouſly charge and recharge; ſhall all the powers of your Grief dare any further to reſiſt, or ſo much as to face me? They dare not. I have conquer'd, and with this Omen, let the Signal be given. Whereas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Lipſius</hi> all thoſe Affections vvhich do ſo variouſly ruſh upon, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the life of Man, do ſpring from a diſtemper'd Mind: So alſo (in my Opinion) doth that Grief eſpecially vvhich vve eſpouſe upon the publick account. For vvhereas the reſt of the Affections have ſome end and ſcope as it were; (as the Lover to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101013:46"/>enjoy, the Angry to revenge, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous to heap up, and ſo in the reſt) to this alone you ſhall find nothing propoſed beſides it ſelf. But leſt my diſcourſe ſhould be too looſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; I ſhall curbe and reſtrain it vvithin this compaſs. You lament you ſay your falling Country. But to vvhat end I beſeech ye? For what hope you, or vvhat do you expect thereby? Is it that thou mayeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair it in its decayes, and underprop it vvhere it yields? Or is it that by grieving you may keep off that Plague and miſchief under vvhich your Country labours? None of all theſe: It is only that you may uſe that thredbare ſaying, it troubles me; as to any thing elſe this lamentation is but vain and unprofitable. For it concernes a thing paſt; vvhich to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover again, and to render undone; the Gods themſelves would not have it in their own power. But is your Grief only vain? Yes, poſſibly it is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101013:47"/>impious alſo, if you ſhall rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it. For (as you know) there is an eternal Mind vvhich vve call God, vvhich Rules, Orders and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the laſting Orbs of Heaven; the different courſes of the Stars; the interchangeable variations of the Elements; and (in a vvord) all things vvhatſoever, as vvell above as below us. Suppoſe you that any Chance or Fortune bare rule in this beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Body of the World? Or that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs are hurried on, and blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together by a raſh and blind im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity? I know you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; nor doth any other, vvho hath any thing (not to ſay) of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but Sobriety. For it is the Voice of Nature, I ſay of Nature, and vvhereſoever you ſhall turne your Eye or Mind: Things Mortal and Immortal, Superiour and Inferiour, Animate or Inanimate, they all ſpeak out and proclaim, that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above us, vvhich hath created
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101013:47"/>and made thoſe ſo vvonderful, ſo great, and ſo numerous things; and being ſo created and made, doth alſo ſtill continue to direct, and preſerve them. This now is God, to whoſe ſuperexcellent and moſt perfect Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there is nothing more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, than that he ſhould be at once both able and vvilling to undertake the Care and Guardianſhip of all that he hath made. And how ſhall he not be vvilling vvho is the BEST? Or how ſhould he not be able vvho is the GREATEST? So farr are any forces from being ſuperiour to his, that all are Derivative from him. Nor doth this vaſtneſs or variety of things either moleſt, or remove him from their inſpection: For that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal light doth every vvay emit its rayes, and vvith one and the ſame dint (as I may ſay) doth pierce all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements and Abyſſes of Heaven, Earth, and Sea. Nor doth this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity only preſide over all things,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101013:48"/>but it abides vvith; yea reſides vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them. Why do ye vvonder at this? What a part of the World doth this Sun at once Survey, and inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en? What a Maſs of things doth this Mind of ours vvith one thought em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and compaſs? And fooles that vve are do vve not believe that more things can be ſeen into, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by him vvho hath created and made this very Sun, and Mind? <hi>Excellently, or rather Divinely ſaid he, who hath not ſaid much in matters Divine, I mean</hi> Ariſtotle; <hi>what the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot (ſaith he) is in the Ship; the Chario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer in the Chariot; the chief Chaunter in the Quire; the Law in a City; or a General in the Army: Such is God in the world, with this only difference, that to them indeed their Government is laborious, toylſome, and perplexing; but that of Gods is without Grief or Labour, and ſevered from all Bodily pains-taking.</hi> There is therefore in God, <hi>Lipſius,</hi> there vvas, and ſhall be

Now this is that vvhich I here call Providence; of vvhich there are not a few, vvho through vveakneſs may complain, none that can doubt, unleſs they are ſuch as have ſtopp'd their Ears, and hardned themſelves againſt every voice, and the very ſenſe of Nature it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>Every Ebbe and Flow (I ſay) of humane affaires depends upon that Moon; and the Riſe and Sett of Kingdomes upon that Sun. As oft therefore as you give ſcope to your Grief; and ſeem to reſent it, that your Country is thus harraſs'd, and overturn'd; You do not ſo much as conſider, either vvho you are that

It vvas the fiction of Antiquity; that certain Giants did attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne the Gods. To omit Fables, you Complainants are thoſe Giants. For if all theſe things are not only by the permiſſion, but alſo by the immiſſion of Almighty God: You vvho fret and reſiſt, vvhat do you but (as much as in you lyes) ſeiſe his ſcepter, and intrench upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of his Empire? Blind Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality! The Sun, Moon, Starrs, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, and all the ſucceſſive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Creatures, do vvillingly obey, and ſubmit themſelves to this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Law; only the Nobleſt piece of the Creation, Man lifts up his heel againſt, and replyes upon his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. Had you hoiſted Sailes into the juriſdiction of the Winds, you

And ſhall you in the Ocean of this life refuſe to follow the conduct of that Spirit by vvhom the vvhole Univerſe is ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? In vain notwithſtanding is this refuſal, for either you ſhall vvilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow, or be forc'd along; and thoſe Heavenly decrees ſhall preſerve their Efficacy, and Order, vvhether you ſhall comply or rebel. We ſhould ſmile at that Man vvho having ty'd his Boat to ſome Rock, and pulling at the Cord, ſhould rather think he pulls the Rock to him than that his boat moves to it: And is not our Folly every vvay as remarkable, vvho being chain'd to that Rock of Eternal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, do yet by our ſtruggling and reſiſtance ſeem to deſire that it ſhould obey us, rather than vve it? Let us free our ſelves at the laſt from theſe Vanities; and (if vve are vviſe) let us follow that Power vvhich attracts us from above, and think it nothing but
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101013:51"/>equal that vvhatſoever is pleaſing to God, ſhould (for that very reaſon) be ſo alſo to Man. The Souldier in the Camp upon Notice of a March, gets on his knap-ſack; but if it ſound to Armes, he layes it aſide, as one vvho vvith his Mind, and Eyes, and Ears, is intent upon, and prepared for any command.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:101013:52"/>A valiant, ſtout, and Steel temper'd Squadron it is; and ſuch as I may not unfitly compare to that Legion vvhich the Romans call'd <hi>Fulminatrix:</hi> The ſtubborn and unbroken force of it is ſuch, as doth conquer and ſubdue all things, and I ſhall vvonder <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> if you ſhould be able to reſiſt it. <hi>Thales</hi> vvhen one ask'd him vvhat vvas the ſtrongeſt, anſwered rightly, neceſſity; for that Conquers all things. There is an old ſaying too, about the ſame thing; although not ſo adviſed, that the Gods themſelves cannot force neceſſity. This neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity I annex to Providence, becauſe of its near relation to it; or to ſpeak truly, becauſe it is born of it. For this neceſſity is from God, and his decrees; nor is it any other thing than as the Greek Philoſopher hath defin'd it: A FIRME SANC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION AND IMMUTABLE POWER OF PROVIDENCE. Now that it doth intervveave and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101013:53"/>twiſt it ſelf vvith publick Evils; I ſhall evince two vvayes, from things themſelves; and from Fate. From things themſelves, becauſe it is the Nature of all created beings, to haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en unto their change and fall, from a certain inward proneneſs, vvhich they have thereunto.

Look upon things above or below, great or ſmall, the vvorkes of the Hand or Mind; they have periſhed from the firſt Ages; and ſhall perſiſt ſo to do unto the laſt. And as all Rivers journey towards the Ocean vvith a prone and haſty current: So all humane things ſlide along by this Channel (as I may call it) of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, unto their utmoſt periods.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101013:53"/>That Period is Death and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and thereunto Peſtilence, vvarr, and Slaughter are as ſubſervient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments: So that if Death is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to theſe things, upon the ſame Ground are Calamities alſo.

They ſhoot and fall; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the vvit of Man may ſeek to palliate and excuſe the matter; Yet there have and vvill be ſuch acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents amongſt thoſe celeſtial Bodies; as may poſe the skill, and ſtagger the Minds of the ableſt Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician. I omit to ſpeak of Commets of various Form, and different Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation and Motion; concerning vvhich, that they all have their Birth from, and Motion in the Air, is a thing vvhich Philoſophy it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily perſwade me to believe. But behold (of late) there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain new kinds of Motion and Starrs found out, vvhich have cut out vvork for the Aſtrologers. There aroſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101013:55"/>a Starr in this very year, vvhoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement and decreaſes vvere through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerv'd; and we then ſaw (vvhat will ſcarcely be believ'd) that in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf, there may be ſomething Born and Dye. Behold even <hi>Varro</hi> in St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> cryes out and aſſerts, that the Planet <hi>Venus</hi> vvhich <hi>Plautus</hi> calls <hi>Veſperugo</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi>

                     </gap>, hath chang'd its colour, magnitude, figure, and motion. Next to the Heavens look upon the Air, it is daily changed, and paſſes into vvinds, Clouds, or ſhowres. Look to the vvaters, and thoſe Rivers and ſprings vvhich vve call everlaſting: Some are loſt, and others have altered their courſe, and found out new Channels. The Ocean it ſelf that great and abſtruſe part of Nature, is ſometimes ſwell'd vvith ſtormes, and at others ſmooth'd vvith calmes, and though thoſe ſtormes vvere not, yet it hath its own Ebbs and Flowes; and to convince us that it may to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101013:55"/>periſh; It doth daily increaſe or decreaſe in its parts. Look now upon the Earth vvhich alone ſome vvould have immoveable; and to ſtand by its own ſtrength: Behold there it totters, and is ſhaken into a palſy fit, by the ſtruggling of thoſe vapours that are pent up in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of it, and elſewhere it is corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Waters or Fires. For even theſe are at conteſt vvith one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that you may not reſent it over deeply, that there are vvarrs amongſt Men: The very Elements have theirs alſo. How many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, hath a ſudden Deluge, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation of the Sea, either leſſen'd, or intirely ſwallowed up. Of old that great Iſland <hi>Atlantis</hi> (for I think it no Fable) afterwards <hi>Helice</hi> and <hi>Bura:</hi> And (that vve may not have recourſe only to ancient and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote times) amongſt us <hi>Belgians</hi> (in the Memory of our Fathers) two Iſlands; together vvith their Townes,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:101013:56"/>and inhabitants. Even at this very day that blew Deity, is forcing open to it ſelf new creeks; and daily frets and vveares away the unfaithfull ſhores of the <hi>Friſians</hi> and <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Nor doth the Earth her ſelf alvvayes give vvay by a Womanniſh ſloth; but doth ſometimes vindicate its loſſes, and in the midſt of the Sea frames Iſlands for its ſelf; to the vvonder and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of that hoary god. Now if thoſe great (and in our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion eternal) Bodies, are deſtined to their deſtruction and change; vvhat ſhall vve think of Cities, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, and Kingdomes; which muſt needs be as mortal as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of them? As particular perſons have their Youth, Maturity, Old-Age, and Death: So theſe, they riſe, grow, ſtand, flouriſh; and all theſe to that very purpoſe that they may fall. In the reign of <hi>Tiberius</hi> one ſingle Earth-quake overthrew twelve
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101013:56"/>famous Cities of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and another did the like to as many Townes in <hi>Campania,</hi> in the reign of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine;</hi> and one vvarre of <hi>Attila</hi> more than an hundred.

For now laying ſwords aſide, I come to my Enſignes, and ſhall aſſault that Grief of yours, not with Arrowes, but more formidable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions. I ſhall inforce againſt it the Ramme of Fate, an Enſigne of that ſtrength and firmneſs; as no humane power or policy ſhall be ever able either to clude or reſiſt. And howſoever the Ground is ſlippery e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to endanger a fall: Yet I ſhall adventure upon it, though vvith a cautious ſlowneſs, and as the Greeks ſay vvith a modeſt foot. In the Firſt
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101013:59"/>place therefore, that there is a Fate in things, neither you <hi>Lipſius,</hi> nor (as I conceive) any Nation or Age did ever doubt.

Weak is this Ramme, <hi>Langius,</hi> and ſuch as is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the enervate and languid forces of the Stoicks.

You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, unleſs together with it, you deny the very Power and Being of a Deity: For if God is, Providence is; if Providence, than a decreed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things; and if ſo than a firme and eſtabliſh'd Neceſſity of events,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101013:60"/>How do you vvard this blow? Or vvith vvhat Ax do you ſever the Links of this Chain?

                  <p>Natural Fate; I call ſuch an Order of Natural cauſes vvhich (unleſs they are hindred) do by their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and efficacy produce alwayes a certain and the ſame effect. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> is for ſuch a Fate if vve may credit <hi>Alexander Aphrodiſienſis</hi> one of the moſt Faithful of his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and of the like Mind vvas <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus;</hi> vvho plainly aſſerts that Fate is nothing elſe, but every Mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Agreeable to thoſe Mens O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101013:62"/>it is, that a man's begetting a Man, is by Fate; that if a man ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to his death; by internall cauſes; vvithout the acceſſion of ſuch as are forreigne, and outward; this is by Fate: On the other-ſide that a Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a Serpent or ſome other Monſter this is not by Fate, neither if he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by the Sword or Fire. An o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion truly not very peccant; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it riſes not to the force and height of Fate: And how can that be in danger of falling vvhich never adventures to climb? And ſuch is <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> almoſt every vvhere in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine matters; I except only that little Book of his, <hi>de Mundo;</hi> vvhich is a golden one indeed; and ſuch as ſeems to me, to be inſpired by ſome other and more heavenly Genius. I read alſo farther in a Greek Writer; that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> vvas of Opinion: That Fate it ſelf is not a cauſe, but a certain accidental Mode to the cauſe; in ſuch things as proceed from Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101013:63"/>O the courage of a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher! Who durſt ſeriouſly Number, Fortune and chance amongſt the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but not Fate. But I paſs him, and return to my Stoicks (for not to diſſemble I have a great affection and eſteem for that Sect) vvho are the Authors of violent Fate; vvhich I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine vvith <hi>Seneca,</hi> ſuch a Neceſſity of all things and actions: as no power is able to interrupt: Or vvith <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippus;</hi> a ſpiritual power that doth orderly govern this vvhole Univerſe. Nor are theſe Definitions very remote from that vvhich is right and true: if they may have a ſound and modeſt interpretation: As neither is their vvhole Opinion perhaps; vvere it not that it hath been already murthered by the retorted Thumbs of the whole hand of the vulgar. Theſe charge them vvith two crimes; that they ſubject God himſelf to the diſpoſal of Fate: and that they place alſo, the internal actions of our vvill, under
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101013:63"/>the ſame power. Nor vvill I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confidently undertake to clear them of either of theſe faults. For amongſt thoſe few of their vvritings vvhich are yet extant, there are ſuch, from vvhence theſe Tenents may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; as there are others, from vvhence, vvee may receive that vvhich is ſound and Orthodox. It muſt be confeſs'd that <hi>Seneca</hi> (no mean Trumpet of that School) ſeems to daſh upon that firſt Rock, in that Book (vvhere he had leaſt Reaſon to do ſo) of Providence. <hi>The ſame Neceſſity ſaith he doth bind even the Gods themſelves, that irrevocable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree doth equally carry along with it, both humane and Divine things. The great Creator and Ruler of all things; did indeed write down this Law of Fate: But he followes it himſelf; and ever obeys, what he once commanded.</hi> And that indiſſoluble Chain, and twiſt of cauſes, vvhereunto they faſten all things and Perſons, ſeems (and that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101013:64"/>not Obſcurely neither) to offer violence to the vvill of Man. But the Genuine and true Stoicks, did never openly avouch theſe things. Or if any ſuch matter, did fall from them (as it is poſſible enough) in their heat of writing and diſpute; you ſhall rather find it in vvords, than in their ſenſe and meaning. <hi>Chryſippus</hi> himſelf vvho firſt corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Enervated that Maſculine Sect, vvith the intricate niceneſs of Queſtions, he in <hi>Agellius</hi> ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently cleares them from attempting upon the liberty of the vvill. Nor doth our <hi>Seneca</hi> ſubject God to Fare (he vvas better adviſed) but (in a certain Mode of ſpeech) God to God. For thoſe amongſt them, vvho came neareſt to the truth, do by Fate ſometimes underſtand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and at others, God. <hi>And therefore</hi> Zeno <hi>when he defines Fate to be a power moving the matter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame reſpects, in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101013:64"/>ſame manner, he adds; it matters not, if I had called it, either Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence or Nature.</hi> And <hi>Chryſippus</hi> from the ſame Principle, doth elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where call Fate, the Eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Providence. Now <hi>Paneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Stoick, affirm'd that God himſelf vvas Fate; and the ſame thing is clearly the Opinion of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca: You may (ſaith he) as you pleaſe, vary the Title of this Author of things, and Natures: You may lawfully call him, either the beſt and greateſt</hi> Jove; <hi>or the Thunderer, or the Stayer: Nor for that Reaſon which Hiſtorians aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne; becauſe after a Vow made to him; He ſtayed the flying Army of the</hi> Romans, <hi>but he is therefore the Stayer and Eſtabliſher, becauſe all things do stand, and conſiſt by his goodneſs, neither ſhall you erre, if you call him Fate.

                  <head>CHAP. XIX. <hi>The Fourth, true Fate explained. Of its Name, its Definition. How it differs from Providence.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BUt I have ſaid enough of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and diſſents of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, for why ſhould I over curiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ſubtilly ſearch into the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Hell? my buſineſs is vvith true Fate; this I ſhall now propound and illuſtrate. And I here call it, an eternal decree of Providence, vvhich is as inſeparable from things, as Providence it ſelf. Nor let any one cavil at the Name; for I do confidently affirm that the Latine lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage doth not afford any other that is proper to the thing. Did the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients abuſe it? Let us uſe it never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs; and inlarging the vvord from the Priſon of the Stoicks, let us bring
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:101013:66"/>it forth into a better light. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Fate is derived a <hi>fando</hi> from ſpeaking: Nor is it properly any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Divine Sentence and injunction, vvhich is that very thing I here mean by it. For I define the true Fate either vvith the illuſtrious <hi>Picus Mirandula,</hi> a Series and Order of Cauſes depending upon Divine Counſel, or in my own termes (though not ſo plainly, yet more exactly) an immoveable decree of Providence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in things moveable, vvhich ſurely diſpoſes every of them in its own Order, Place and Time. I call it a decree of Providence; for I am not altogether of the ſame Mind, vvith the Divines of our dayes (I crave leave for a free Inveſtigation of Truth) vvho confound it as vvell in Name as Thing vvith Providence it ſelf. I know it is a high and raſh preſumption to enterprize the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal and limitation of that ſuperſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial and ſuperceleſtial Nature (I
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:101013:67"/>mean God) or vvhatſoever pertains to him, vvithin the compaſs of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Termes: Yet according to our humane capacity; I am ſenſible that Providence is one thing properly, and this Fate I am ſpeaking of is another. For I apprehend not, nor conceive of Providence any otherwiſe, than that it is a faculty and power in God, by vvhich he ſees, knows and governs all things; ſuch a power (I mean) as is univerſal, undivided, guarded, and as <hi>Lucretius</hi> faith firmly united. But now the notion of Fate, ſeems rather to deſcend to things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in each of them to be obſerved: That ſo there may be ſuch a digeſtion and explication of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Providence, as is diſtinct and agreeable to its parts. Providence therefore is in God, and is aſcribed unto him alone: Fate is in things, and to them it is aſcribed. It is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible I may ſeem to you to trifle, and as (one ſaith) to drill Millet. No
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101013:67"/>
                     <hi>Lipſius</hi> I have theſe things from the common diſcourſes of the Vulgar, amongſt whom nothing is more uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all than to ſay, this or that came to paſs, by my Good or Evil Fate: This is the Fate of that Kingdom or City. But of Providence no man vvill ſpeak after this manner: I mean none can attribute it to things themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impiety or folly. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtly ſaid that Providence is in God: Fate is indeed from God, but is underſtood in things. I add fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that howſoever Providence is really inſeparable from Fate, yet it ſeems to be ſomething more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and ſuperiour to it, as vve com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay in the Schools, the Sun excells Light, Eternity Time; and the intellect Reaſon. Not to enlarge my ſelf any farther about theſe ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (though uncommon matters) by what hath paſſed, you may readily apprehend the Reaſon of my diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; as alſo of my retaining the old
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101013:68"/>Name, againſt the new Senate of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. For thoſe ancient and hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Conſcript Fathers; do not at all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me, but that I may very freely uſe this word Fate, in the ſound and true notion of it. But to return to the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my Definition, I call'd it an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Decree; to ſhew that Fate is to be obſerved in thoſe things to vvhich, not in him from vvhence it comes. I added in moveable things; ſignifying thereby, that howſoever Fate it ſelf is immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, yet it doth not deſtroy the infixed Nature, and proper motion of things but acts in a mild and gentle vvay, according as thoſe marks and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters do require vvhich God hath engraven upon every thing: In cauſes (I underſtand ſecond ones) neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, neceſſaril<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; in natural ones na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally; in contingent, contingently. In reſpect therefore of things, it is no vvay violent or compulſory, but bends and leads on every thing, according as the Nature of it is to do or ſuffer.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101013:68"/>But if you reduce it to its own Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, that is to ſay to Providence and God: Then I muſt affirm vvith the greateſt Conſtancy and boldneſs, that all things vvhich are by Fate, do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily come to paſs. I added in the laſt place ſomewhat of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Time, and Place, confirming vvhat I had before aſſerted; that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is of all things taken together, but Fate is by vvay of diſtribution of particulars. By Order I underſtand a Series of Cauſes vvhich Fate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines. By Place, and Time I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that vvonderfull and inexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power, by vvhich all Events are ty'd to certain circumſcriptions of place, and moments of time. Is it the Fate of <hi>Tarquine</hi> to be expell'd his Kingdom? Let it be done, but vvithall let Adultery precede. You ſee the Order: Is it the Fate of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> to be ſlain? Be it ſo; but be it alſo in the Senate-houſe, and at the foot of <hi>Pompey's</hi> Statue. You ſee
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:101013:69"/>the Place. Shall <hi>Domitian</hi> be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd by his Servants? Let him fall, but let it be in that very hour, which he ſought in vain to decline, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fifth, you ſee the time.</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:101013:69"/>vvhat means the ſubtile thread of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions? What captious ſnares of queſtions are theſe? Believe me, I vvas in fear of ſome ſtratagem; and began to be as ſuſpitious of theſe your vveigh'd and vvary vvords, as of ſo many Enemies. <hi>Langius</hi> ſmiling; you may be confident (ſaid he) no <hi>Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> is here, nor are you fallen into an Ambuſh, but into a ſafe place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. I ſhall very vvillingly enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en you; declare only vvhere and in vvhat part it is you deſire a further ſatisfaction. There <hi>Langius</hi> (ſaid I) vvhere you ſpeak of force and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. For I am not able to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, vvhich vvay you diſſever this Fate of yours, from that of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks. For howſoever you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it in vvords, and (as they ſay) at the Portall; yet in reality and at the Poſtern, you ſeem to me to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it. <hi>Langius</hi> readily, farr, farr be it from me <hi>Lipſius</hi> ſaid he; I vvould not ſo much as in my dreams intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:101013:70"/>that Fate of the Stoicks; nor do I endeavour to revive thoſe long ſinceex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired Beldames the deſtinies: It is a modeſt and pious fate I contend for, and vvhich differs from the violent one theſe four vvayes. The Stoicks ſubject God to Fate; neither was <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf in <hi>Homer</hi> able to exempt his <hi>Sarpedon</hi> from its bonds, when he carneſtly deſired it, But we on the contrary ſubject Fate to God vvhom vve acknowledge to be a moſt free Author, and independent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in all things: Who vvhen he pleaſes can ſurpaſs, and break through all the ſtrengths, and intricate foldings of Fate. They alſo conſtitute a Series and Flux of Natural cauſes from Eternity; vve admit not ſuch a Series of theſe cauſes vvithout interruption (for God makes Prodigies, and worketh Miracles, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entimes beſides, yea contrary to Nature) nor can this Series of cauſes be from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. For Second cauſes are not Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as having (moſt certainly) their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginings vvith that of the world. Thirdly,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:101013:70"/>they ſeem to have remov'd contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from things; vve reſtore it, and as often as ſecond cauſes are ſuch, vve admit contingency and accident in events. Laſtly, they ſeem to have brought in a violent force upon the Will; this is farr from us, vvho as vve do aſſert Fate, ſo vve reconcile it with the Liberty of the Will. For vve ſo avoid the deceitfull Guſt of Fortune and Chance, as that yet vve do not force our Ship upon the Rock of Neceſſity. Is there Fate? That Fate is the firſt cauſe, which is ſo farr from removing the ſecond and ſubordinate ones, that ordinarily, and for the moſt part, it acts not but by them. Now amongſt theſe ſecond cauſes is the Will, vvhich never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God vvill either enforce or deſtroy. Here is all the Errour, and Cloud in this matter, no Man knowes or thinks that he wills what Fate vvills, and yet that he wills it freely. For that God who created all things,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:101013:71"/>employes thoſe things, vvithout the deſtruction of them. As the higheſt Heaven doth ſo carry along with it all the inferiour Orbs, as not to ſtop, or break off the proper motion of any of them: So God by the force of Fate diſpoſes of all things; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes not the peculiar power or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any of them. Is it his vvill that Trees, and Fruits ſhould grow? They do ſo by Nature, without any compulſion. Is it his pleaſure that Men ſhould deliberate, and chooſe? They deliberate without any inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they chooſe vvith their own vvill. And yet God from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity foreſaw that very thing in which their choice vvould determine: But he only foreſaw, he did not inforce; he knew, but did not enjoyn; he foretold it, but he did not preſcribe it. Why ſtumble our Curioſo's at this? Poor wretches! There is no point, that ſeems to me, to carry a greater evidence of truth vvith it;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101013:71"/>vvere it not for that vvanton Mind of ours vvhich (being infected vvith an evil Itch of wrangling and diſpute) is ever and anon urging and exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating it ſelf. For (ſay they) if God foreſaw that I ſhould ſin; and this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of his is no vvay to be deceiv'd: How can it otherwiſe be, but that I ſhould ſin Neceſſarily? I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it is Neceſſarily, but not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of your Mind; ſince your own free vvill doth here intervene. For he foreſaw that you ſhould ſin the ſame vvay he foreſaw; but he foreſaw you ſhould do it freely, and therefore of Neceſſity you muſt ſin freely. Is not this ſufficiently clear? But they urge again; that God is the Author of all motions in us. He is indeed (I confeſs) the Author of all motions in common, but the fautor, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of nothing but vvhat is good. Do you prepare your ſelf to an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is virtuous? He knowes and aſſiſts it. Or to one that is vitious?
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101013:72"/>He knows, and permits it, nor is he herein chargeable vvith any fault. I ride upon, and ſpur a dull and lame Horſe, that I ſpur him is from me, that he is dull is from himſelf. I play upon a Harp that is out of tune, and ill ſtrung: You vvill eaſily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the diſcordancy of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is not imputable to me, but to it ſelf. This very Earth doth feed all ſorts of Trees and Plants vvith one common juice; and yet ſome of theſe bring forth vvholeſome Fruits, and ſome others Poyſons. What vvill you here ſay? That this is from the Earth? Or rather in that inbred Nature of the Trees, which converts the good nouriſhment, into their own poyſon? In like manner it is here: That you move is from God; from your ſelf, and in your ſelf, that you move to Evil. Finally, that I may at laſt finiſh my diſcourſe about this Liberty; Fate is as it were the Leader of the Dance, in this Maſque of the world: But ſo,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:101013:72"/>that we alſo have our parts to act, of alwayes vvilling or nilling; but not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of effecting. For it is only a will that is left unto Man whereby he may be deſirous to oppugne and reſiſt God: But he hath not a power whereby he is able. As I may vvalk up and dovvn the Decks and Hatches of a Ship; but this little motion doth not at all avail to hinder its courſe: So in this fatall Ship, in vvhich vve are all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd, though our vvills move this or that vvay, they are not able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, or put a ſtop to it. For that ſupream Will will alwayes hold and manage the reines, and guide this Chariot, with a gentle kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

Who (as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Hippo</hi> ſaid elegantly) vvhile he made Men Free, made them Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious. Hovv many even at this day are ſwimming in this Sea; and at length carry'd away vvith the Waves
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101013:73"/>of diſputation. By vvhoſe dangers <hi>Lipſius</hi> vve being vvarned let us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chooſe to coaſt about the Shore, than to hazzard our ſelves too farr in the depths of this Ocean. <hi>Euclid</hi> to one that ask'd him many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Gods, made this appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite reply: Other things I know not; but this I know that they hate the curious. Think the ſame of Fate, vvhich vvill be look'd upon, but not pry'd into; believ'd, but not known. I think it is the ſaying of <hi>Bias;</hi> of the Gods ſay that they are, vvhich I may pertinently apply unto Fate, of vvhich I adviſe you, that it is enough if you knovv it to be: in other matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, it is no Sin to be ignorant. That properly belongs to our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince (for I novv return from this intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led path into the old and beaten vvay) that you believe there is a Neceſſity an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd to publick evils: and that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from thence ſome conſolation in your Griefs.

Thy <hi>Syracuſe</hi> is taken, and thou art drawing lines in the duſt. Warr is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thee, Tyranny, Slaughters, Death, which certainly are ſent from above, and not at all under the diſpoſal of thy Will. Theſe things you may fear but not prevent: Fly, but not be able to evade.

I vvill ſit (ſay you) vvith my hands folded; 'tis well; I vviſh you had done ſo vvith your Lips too.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:101013:76"/>force of Fate, doth corrupt the Councells of him, vvhoſe Fortune it is determin'd to change: And again it comes to paſs for the moſt part that God perverts their Councels, vvhoſe Fortune he is about to alter; and (vvhich is the greateſt unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) ſo orders things, that thoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities vvhich happen to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſeem deſervedly to have fallen upon them. Neither ought you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to conclude, that the laſt and fatal revolution is now come upon your Country. For how do you know it? Or vvhich vvay can you be certain, vvhether it is ſome light diſtemper, or a Diſeaſe unto Death? Aſſiſt her therefore, and vvhile the Patient hath yet breath (as they ſay) hope. But if by certain and infallible diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, it ſhall appear, that its fatall change is upon it; then (in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) that is vvholſome advice; fight not againſt God. That Example of <hi>Solon</hi> I may here ſafely commend,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:101013:77"/>vvho vvhen <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> had ſeiſed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;</hi> and he ſaw that all endeavours for Liberty vvere vain, laying down his ſhield and armes at the doors of the Curia: O my Country ſaid he, I have aſſiſted thee both vvith my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells and actions; and ſo vvent home, reſolving for the future to be quiet. Do you thus, give place to God, give place to the times; and if you are a good Common-wealths Man, reſerve your ſelf to better and more gentle Fates. That Liberty which is now periſh'd, may revive; and your Country vvhich is now fallen, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time may yet ariſe: Why do you unadviſedly deſpond, and caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay your courage? Of thoſe two Conſuls at <hi>Cannas</hi> I eſteem <hi>Varro</hi> a gallanter Perſon vvho fled, than <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> that fell: Nor did the Senate and People of <hi>Rome</hi> judge otherwiſe, who gave him publick thanks, that he did not deſpair of the Common-vvealth. But vvhether your Country do only
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101013:77"/>totter, or vvhether it fall; vvhether it languiſh only, or vvholly periſh: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict not your ſelf overmuch, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe that noble courage of <hi>Crates,</hi> vvho vvhen <hi>Alexander</hi> asked him, if he could vviſh his Country might be reſtor'd?

I am ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther induc'd to believe this; inaſmuch
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:101013:81"/>as it is not very eaſie to think of any one pleaſure, in vvhich the moſt eminent amongſt the Nations have in all ages ſo vvillingly conſented. If vve turne over the ſacred Volume, vve ſhall there find that the World and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens vvere made together, vvhich God himſelf beſtow'd upon the firſt Man, as the Seat of a bleſſed Life: If vve ſearch into prophane Stories, Proverbs and Fables every vvhere tell us of the Gardens of <hi>Adonis</hi> and <hi>Alcinous, Tantalus</hi> and the <hi>Heſperides:</hi> and in true and credible Hiſtories, vve meet the mention of King <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Orchards, that were planted with his own Hands: The airy and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Gardens of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> and that new and celebrated Plat of <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> vvhich <hi>Affrick</hi> vvondred at. Amongſt the ancient Greeks and Romans, how many illuſtrious perſons am I able to name; vvho caſting off all other cares, have betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only to this? Amongſt the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101013:81"/>it vvill ſuffice to ſay in ſhort, that moſt of the Philoſophers and Sages, removing from Cities and the wild cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the Courts; have cloyſtred up themſelves vvithin private limits and bounds. And amongſt the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, methinks I ſee King <hi>Tarquine</hi> (in that then ancient <hi>Rome</hi>) diverting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Gardens, and ſmiting off the heads of the Poppyes. <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſour applying himſelf to this ſtudy, and vvriting Books vvith all ſeriouſneſs about theſe matters. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus</hi> retiring to his Gardens, after all his Aſiatique Triumphs. <hi>Sylla</hi> having lay'd down his Dictatorſhip doth here more contentedly grow old; and <hi>Diocleſian</hi> the Emperour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres his Sallads and Lettuce at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona;</hi> before the imperial purple, and all the Scepters of the Univerſe. Nor have the Vulgar receded from the Judgement of their ſuperiours; but even amongſt them the honeſter ſort, and ſuch as vvere free from am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:101013:82"/>vvere generally this way ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted. For certainly there is a kind of ſecret impulſe, that vvith us is born; the hidden Cauſes of which I cannot eaſily explicate; which thruſts into this innocent and ingenuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; not only us vvho bend that vvay, but even thoſe ſerious and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere perſons; who both reſiſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride it. And as none do behold the Heavens, and thoſe eternal Fires; without a ſecret kind of horror and Religion; ſo neither do any take a view of the Sacred Treaſures of the Earth, and the beautiful Ornaments of this lower World, without a ſilent kind of Guſt and Titillation of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Enquire but of your Mind and Soul, and it will confeſs it ſelf not only to be ſurpriz'd; but even fed with ſuch a proſpect. Ask your Eyes and Senſes and they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that they do not any where more willingly repoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Look round about I beſeech
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:101013:82"/>you for a while, and obſerve the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral troops of Flowers, together vvith the manner of their growth. Behold how this uncupps, and that unſheathes, and this other ſwells it ſelf out of the rich incloſure of it's Gemm-like Bud. See how ſuddenly the one expires, and the other ſhoots out to ſucceed it; to conclude, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in any one kind of them, the Beauty, Forme, and Appearance, a thouſand vvayes divers and the ſame. What Mind is there ſo rigid, that in ſuch entertainments as theſe, vvill not vvithdraw and melt it ſelf, into ſoft and pleaſing Meditations? Let the curious Eye dwell a while upon thoſe Orient and dazeling Colours: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this native Purple, this Blood, this Ivory, this Snow, this Flame, this Gold, and ſuch diverſity of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; as a skilful Pencil may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly emulate, but can never be able to expreſs?

                  <p>WHen I had ſpoken this ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhat earneſtly, and vvith a kind of Ardour both in voice and countenance; <hi>Langius</hi> looking mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon me: Certainly ſaid he <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> you are enamour'd of this florid and purple Nymph; and I am ſolicitous, leſt you ſhould love her immodeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For you praiſe Gardens, but yet ſo, as to admire only thoſe things vvhich are vain and external; vvhile you omit to ſpeak of the true and lawful Pleaſures of them. You greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold the colours, and repoſe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:101013:84"/>in the beds, and enquire after Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from the known and unknown World? But for vvhat purpoſe I pray? Is it to aſſure me that you alſo are one of that newly ſprung up Sect of curious and idle perſons; vvho have converted the moſt excellent and ſimple delight, into the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a couple of Vices; Vanity, and Sloth? For to this end have they their Gardens, vvith an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious curioſity they ſearch after a few forraign Plants and Flowers; and vvhen they have them, they cheriſh and attend them, vvith the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety and paſſion, as a Mother doth her Son. Theſe are they vvhoſe Letters vvander into <hi>Thrace, Greece, India,</hi> for ſome little parcel of ſeed, a Clove, or off-ſet of a Flower: Who more paſſionately lament the vvithering of ſome new faſhioned Slipps; than the Death of an old try'd Friend. Does any Man laugh at that <hi>Roman,</hi> who put on mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101013:84"/>for the Death of his Lamprey? After the ſame manner bewail they the Funerals of their Flowers. Now if any of theſe Candidates of <hi>Flora</hi> have got any thing more new or rare, O how he boaſts it! How do his Corrivals emulate and envy him? Some of vvhom return no leſs pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to their Houſes than <hi>Sylla</hi> or <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> vvhen they vvere rejected in their ſuit for the Pretorſhip. What ſhall I call this but a merry kind of madneſs? Not unlike to that of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren turning pale, and quarrelling for their Topps and Counters. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand alſo how theſe men imploy themſelves in their Gardens; they ſit, they vvalk round about, they gape and ſleep, and nothing elſe; as if they intended them not as pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of retirement, but as Sepulchres of Sloth. A prophane Generation, and ſuch as I may juſtly exclude from the Orgyes of the true and ſacred Garden, vvhich I know to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:101013:85"/>to modeſt pleaſure, not to Vanity, to eaſe, but not at all to Sloth. Should I be of ſo feeble a temper, that the gain or loſs of a poor Flower, ſhould either exalt or depreſs me? No, I eſteem things at their juſt rates, and ſetting aſide the meretricious advantage of Novelty: I know they are but Plants; I know they are but Flowers: that is, ſhort-liv'd and tranſitory things; of vvhich the Prince of Poets hath pertinently ſpoken,

                           <hi>When the ſoft VVeſtern winds abroad do flye,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I do not then deſpiſe theſe elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and delights (as you ſee) but herein I differ from theſe delicate Hortenſii; that as I get ſuch things as theſe vvithout anxiety, ſo I keep, and ſo I loſe them. Nor am I ſo
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:101013:85"/>ſtupid, or rather ſo dead, that I ſhould cloyſter up, and (as it vvere) bury my ſelf in theſe Garden ſhades: For even in theſe retirements, I find buſineſs, and my Mind doth here meet vvith ſomething vvhich it may performe vvithout action. I am never leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone than vvhen alone (ſaid one;) nor ever leſs at leiſure than when ſo. An excellent ſaying, and vvhich I dare affirm had its birth in ſuch Gardens as theſe, vvhich are intended for the Mind, not the Body; to recreate that, not to diſſolve and ſoften this; and for a ſafe retreat both from Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Cares. Is company trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome? Here you ſhall be vvith your ſelf: Have employments exhauſted your Spirits? Here they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payr'd, vvhere the Mind ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd vvith its proper food of quiet, and vvhere from this purer air, you ſhall have as it were the inſpiration of a new life. If you look therefore upon the ancient Sages, they dwelt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:101013:86"/>in Gardens; or upon the more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and improved Spirits of our times, they delight in Gardens: And in thoſe for the moſt part are thoſe divine pieces compos'd, vvhich are the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Mankind, and vvhich no Age, or ſucceſſions of time ſhall ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh. To this green <hi>Lycaeum</hi> do we ſtand indebted for ſo many Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures upon Nature: To this ſhady <hi>Academy</hi> vve owe thoſe diſcourſes about manners, and from the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of theſe Gardens are thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant ſprings of Wiſdom diffus'd, vvhich we drink of, and vvhich vvith their fertill inundations have enrich'd the World. For the Mind doth raiſe and advance it ſelf to higher and greater things; vvhen free and at large; it beholds its own Heaven, then vvhen 'tis cloyſter'd up within the Priſon of a Houſe or City. Here O ye Poets frame an everlaſting and immortal Verſe; here let the learned meditate and write; here O ye Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:101013:86"/>diſpute of Tranquility, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, of Life, and Death. See <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> the true end and uſe of Gardens; it is reſt, ſeceſſion, meditation, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vvriting; and yet all theſe by way of recreation only, and divertiſement. As Painters vvho by long poring have vvearied and dimm'd their ſight, call it off to certain glaſſes and green ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, thereby to quicken and refreſh it; ſo do vve the Mind when it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtraggles or is tyred. And why ſhould I conceal my Cuſtome from you? Do you ſee that Arbour ſet out vvith Topiary vvork? 'Tis the place I have conſecrated to the Muſes. It is my School of Wiſdom. There I either ſatisfie my Mind with ſerious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd reading, or improve it vvith the Seeds of profitable Meditation? And as arms are lay'd up in a Magazene: So do I from them, ſtore up precepts in my Mind, vvhich are alwayes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by me, againſt every battery and impreſſion of Fortune. As oft as I

O that more than humane life; vvhich I have met with in a Man! Would to God I vvere able in any Meaſure to imitate, and to creep along after theſe footſteps, though it vvere at a conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. <hi>Langius</hi> as reprehending me; imitate ſayes he? Yes excell. You have right here not only to follow,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101013:88"/>but to lead the vvay. For in this Path of Conſtancy and Vertue <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> vve have made but a ſmall, a very ſmall progreſs. As yet vve are not comparable to the more He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick and excellent Perſons, though poſſibly a little more aſſured than the utterly enfeebled and debauched ſort. But you vvhoſe Youthfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations are Generous and Lofty, prepare your ſelf; and agreeable to my inſtructions, aſſay that path which doth directly lead to firmneſs and Conſtancy. The vvay I ſpeak of is Wiſdom, whoſe ſmooth and even path, I beſeech and adviſe you no longer to decline: Hath learning and the Nine Goddeſſes hitherto delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you? I approve it. For I know the Mind ought firſt to be ſubacted and prepar'd with this more pleaſing and external knowledge, as being before unfit to have divine Seeds intruſted vvith it. But vvithall I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove not that you ſhould ſo farr dote
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101013:89"/>upon this as to make it both the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and end of your ſtudies. Theſe are to be our rudiments but not our vvork; our vvay but not our Goale. In a feaſt (I ſuppoſe) you vvould not feed only upon Quelk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choſes or Junkets; but would gratifie your ſtomach vvith ſomething that is more ſolid. In this publick banquet of Learning, why do you not the ſame? Why add you not the firmer food of Philoſophy, to thoſe delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Viands of Oratours and Poets? For (miſtake me not) I vvould not that the one ſhould be deſerted, but that the other ſhould be ſuperadded, and that thoſe looſer, and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more fluid Nymphs ſhould be tempered and mixed, vvith this (as I may call it) ſeverer <hi>Bacchus. Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope's</hi> Suitors in <hi>Homer</hi> are juſtly laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at; vvho deſerting the Miſtreſs fell to courting the Maids: Take heed you do not the ſame, that deſpiſing the great and excellent Princeſs, you
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:101013:89"/>ſhould remain enamour'd of her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids. It is a deſirable purchaſe to attain the praiſe of a learned Man; that of a vviſe Man is beyond it, but that of a good Man ſurpaſſes all. Hereafter let us aim at theſe; and by all our labours endeavour not only to know, but to be vviſe and do:
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>How vaine's that knowledge where</hi>

                        </l>
                     </q> ſayes that old and true Verſe. How many are there in this our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Muſes, vvho diſhonour both themſelves, and the very name of Learning? Some in that they are even covered with the black ſpots of deteſtable impieties; and the moſt becauſe they are vain, light Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours only, and of no worthy deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Do they learn languages? Yes, but languages alone. Do they underſtand the Greek and Latine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors? Yet they do but underſtand
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:101013:90"/>them, and as <hi>Anacharſis</hi> ſaid vvell of the <hi>Athenians</hi> heretofore; they uſed money only to count it: ſo theſe their knowledge only to know. So utterly regardleſs are they of their lives, and of what they do, that (even in my judgement) the vulgar ſeem vvith ſome reaſon to look upon learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Miſtreſs of vice: But it is indeed the Directreſs to vertue; if we uſe it as we ought, and conjoyn it with wiſdom; to which learning ſhould prepare our Minds, but not ſeize upon them, and detain them to it ſelf: For as there are ſome ſorts of Trees, that will bear no fruit, unleſs they are planted by other male ones (as I may call them) ſo will the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Muſes remain barren, unleſs wedded to the Maſculine ſtrength of wiſdom. To what end doſt thou cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <hi>Tacitus?</hi> and at the ſame time ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſo many <hi>Errata</hi>'s in thine own life?

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take your ſelf unto Wiſdom which may reform your manners; calme and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten your troubled and dark Soul.

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn I ſav unto Conſtancy, vvhoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted rites, it vvill be dangerous to deferre. <hi>Langius</hi> as refuſing, ſhall I again ſaid he be ſhut up in that School?

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:101013:92"/>this her dwelling? I mean that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, vvhich to me ſeems a Temple, and the little Table in it, no other than an Altar, at vvhich ſitting down let us Sacrifice to the Goddeſs. Beſides I take an Omen from the very place. What Omen (ſayes <hi>Langius?</hi>) 'Tis this ſaid I, that as he who ſits in a place where Odors and ſweet Unguents are, carrys along with him in his Garments the perfume and ſcent of the place. So I am not without hope, that ſome Air and Odour of Wiſdom may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here unto my Mind, by ſitting in this her Store-houſe.

                  <p>
                     <hi>LAngius</hi> without any conſiderable pawſe thus began. In my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Conſtancy it is fit I be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, I ſhall therefore obſerve the ſame order and method vvhich Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday I propounded. Then (as you know) I form'd Four Squadrons (as I call them) to fight in its behalf againſt grief and dejectedneſs. The two former of theſe, from Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Neceſſity; I have already drawn forth, and have ſufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd that publick evils are ſent down from God; as alſo that they are neceſſary
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:101013:93"/>and impoſſible to be declin'd. I ſhall now therefore bring up my Third Squadron led by Utility; vvhich I may truly call the Legion Adjutrix, a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and ſubtile power, vvhich I know not how doth convey and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate it ſelf into the Minds of Men, and with a pleaſing kind of violence ſo overcomes them, as that themſelves are not unwilling to be conquer'd. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t rather gains upon us by degrees, than by violent impreſſions, and rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades than compells us. For we as readily permit our ſelves to be led by Utility, as drawn by Neceſſity. This <hi>Lipſius</hi> I now oppoſe againſt you and your failing troops. For theſe publick evils vvhich we ſuffer are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and contribute much to our inward advantage. Did I call them Evils? They are rather goods; if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving this veil of Opinion, we have a due recourſe unto their Original and End; of vvhich the former is from good, and the latter is for good. For
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:101013:94"/>the Original of theſe Calamities (as Yeſterday I ſufficiently prov'd) is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly from God: That is, not only from the chiefeſt good it ſelf, but from the Author, cauſe, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all other good vvhatſoever; from vvhom it is as utterly impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any evil ſhould proceed, as that himſelf ſhould be evil. That power is only benign and healthful, equally deſpiſing to receive and to do vvrong, and vvhoſe ſole and chief prerogative it is to benefit. And therefore thoſe ancient and blinder ſort of Men, conceiving ſomething of the ſupream Being in their Minds; did rightly give him his Name from helping. Suppoſe you that he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated, and that as one in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he hurles down theſe evils as ſo many deadly Arrows upon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? No. Anger and Revenge are humane Affections, and being the ef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ects of vveakneſs, are found only amongſt the infirm. But that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:101013:94"/>Being doth eternally perſevere in its benignity, and thoſe very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities vvhich vve taſt off from him, are only as Medicines; ſharp and bitter to the ſenſe, but healthful in their iſſue and events. <hi>That</hi> Homer <hi>of Philoſophers ſaid rightly God doth no evil, and therefore cannot be the cauſe of any. But better and more fully that wiſe one of ours. What is the cauſe of the Gods doing good? Their Nature. He errs that imagines they are either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous or able to do hurt. As they cannot receive, ſo neither can they do an injury. The firſt honor that we owe to the Gods, is to believe that they are, the next is to aſcribe Majeſty to them, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without which there is no Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. To know they are thoſe, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide over the world; who govern all things as their own; who are the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of Mankind, and of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon, and that no evil is in them, neither doth any proceed from them.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>CAlamities then are good in their Original; they are ſo alſo in their End, becauſe they are alwayes dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to our good. You vvill ſay vvhich vvay? Is not miſchief and ruine the manifeſt end of Warr and Slaughter? It is I confeſs if you look at Men, but not if you look upon God. That you may the more clearly apprehend this, It vvill be requiſite thus to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh of divine puniſhments; ſome are ſimple and others are mixt: Thoſe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:101013:95"/>I call ſimple vvhich are immediately from God; vvithout the intervening of any humane Contrivance or Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: The mixt, are ſuch as are from God too; but acted and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Men. Of the former kind are Famine, Barrenneſs, Earth-quakes, Inundations, Diſeaſes, and Death: Of the latter, Tyrannies, Warres, Oppreſſions, Slaughters. The firſt ſort are pure and innocent, as being deriv'd to us from the pureſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: In the other I vvill not deny, but there is ſome mixture of filth, inaſmuch as they paſs through, and are convey'd to us by the impure Channels of Affections. Man inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddles therein, and then vvhat vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is it, if Sin and corruption do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſelf? That is the vvonder that ſuch is the merciful Providence of God, as can convert that poyſon into Medicine, and that Sin into good. See you that Tyrant there, who breaths out nothing but threatnings and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:101013:96"/>vvhoſe delights are in doing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and vvho could be content to periſh himſelf, provided he might thereby accompliſh the deſtruction of others: Let him alone a while, he ſhall fail in his deſignes; and God by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and indiſcernible thread (vvhile he thinks and vvills nothing leſs) ſhall guide him to his end. As the Arrow vvithout any ſenſe of its own, arrives at that mark vvhich the Archer intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo do vvicked Men. For that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream power doth inhibit and reſtrain all humane powers, directing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing all their vvandring ſteps unto that beſt end of his. As in an Army the Souldiers are variouſly affected; ſpoile encourages this, glory him, and hatred that other; but all fight for their Prince and Victory: So every of theſe wills of ours, whether they are good or evil, ſerve under, and fight for God, and amidſt the greateſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of their own deſigned ends, do at laſt touch upon this (as I may ſo call it)
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:101013:96"/>End of Ends. But you vvill ſay vvhy does God uſe the help of the vvicked? Why does not he himſelf ſend that better ſort of Calamities amongſt us; at leaſt the worſer by more deſirable inſtruments? Thou art over curious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inquiſitive O Man: Neither am I certain vvhether I am able to explain theſe Myſteries of Providence. But this I know, that he ſufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the reaſon of his actings; even at ſuch times as we are not able to diſcern the leaſt of it in them. But vvhat is it that appears ſo ſtrange, and unuſual to us? The Ruler of a Province condemnes a malefactour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws; and commits the Execution of his Sentence to <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus</hi> or the Lictor. The Father of a great Family ſometimes corrects his Son himſelf; at others commits it to the care of a Servant or Tutor. Why ſhould not God have the ſame liberty? Why ſhould not he vvhen he ſo pleaſes shaſtiſe us vvith his own hand? And
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:101013:97"/>when he ſees it good vvith anothers? There is no wrong or injury done to us in all this. Does that Servant hate you? Doth he come vvith a Mind to do you a miſchief? It matters not, overlooking the inſtrument of vvhat you ſuffer: Look back to the Mind of him that hath commanded it. For aſſuredly the Father that requires it ſtands by; nor will he ſuffer one ſtripe to be ſuperadded to what himſelf hath preſcribed. But you ask again; why is Sin here immixed? and why are theſe divine Arrowes dipp'd in the poyſon of Affections? You put me upon a difficult task, which yet I ſhall adventure upon; and my anſwer is, that God may declare his Wiſdom and Power. They are St. <hi>Auſtine</hi>'s words; he judg'd it better to make evils good, than to permit no evills at all. For vvhat greater inſtance can there be of Wiſdom and Goodneſs, than to bring good out of evil, and to make thoſe things Conſpire
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:101013:97"/>our welfare, which were found out for our ruine. You commend that Phyſitian who ſucceſſefully mixes his Treacle with a Viper. And why ſhould you reſent it in God, if vvith this Plaiſter of Calamities, he ſhall intermixe ſomething that is hurtfull, vvithout any damage of yours. For he doth certainly decoct and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate all the adhering poyſon, by the ſecret fire of his Providence. Laſtly, this magnifyes his power and glory; to vvhich all things are by himſelf of Neceſſity referr'd. For vvhat can more lively expreſs his power than this? That he not only overcomes thoſe Enemies that wraſtle with him; but alſo overcomes them in ſuch a manner, as brings them over to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and cauſes them to take Armes in the purſuance of his Victories: Which every day comes to paſs, vvhen the vvill of God is done by evill Men, though not of them; ſince he ſo manages all thoſe things which
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101013:98"/>the vvicked do in oppoſition to his vvill; that none of them are beſides his will. And vvhat greater miracle can there be, than that vvicked Men ſhould make vvicked Men good? Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach thou <hi>Cajus Caeſar,</hi> and at once tread under Foot the two Sacred Names of thy County, and Son in Law. This thy ambition vvithout thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall be ſubſervient to God; yes to thy Country it ſelf, againſt vvhich it vvas taken up: For it ſhall prove the reparation and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Roman State. Thou <hi>Attila</hi> fly from the remoteſt parts of the World, and thirſting after blood and ſpoile, Sack, kill, burn, and waſt; all this cruelty ſhall fight for God, and prove nothing elſe but an awakening of the Chriſtians from ſlumbring in the Beds of Pleaſure and Security. You two <hi>Veſpaſians</hi> what do you? Ruine <hi>Judea</hi> and the Jews: Take, and raze the whole City; but for what end? As you indeed intend

Let us therefore <hi>Lipſius</hi> rather admire than buſily pry into this recluded Power of his Wiſdom, and let us know, that all ſorts of Calamities are good in their events: Although this Mind of ours be ſo blind as not to diſcern it, or ſo ſlow in its apprehenſions as not to reach and comprehend it.

                  </p>
                  <p>For there are ſome of them, which methinks I am able with ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty to comprehend and point out, but there are others vvhich I can only rove and gueſs at. Of the more apparent ones, are theſe three; to Exerciſe, Chaſtiſe, and Puniſh us. For if you obſerve it, the moſt uſual and ordinary calamities do either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the good, or chaſtiſe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, or puniſh the wicked; and all this for our good. For (to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and dwell awhile upon the firſt End) we daily ſee the beſt Men ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſs'd by calamities ſingly and apart by themſelves; or elſe incloſed by them, in ſociety with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We obſerve and vvonder at it;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:101013:100"/>as neither ſufficiently comprehending the cauſe; nor rightly conſidering the End. Now the cauſe is the love of God towards us, not his hate; and the End is not our hurt, but our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit. For this exerciſe doth advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage us more wayes than one: It ſtrengthens us, it tryes us, and it fits us to lead on others. It ſtrengthens us, being (as it vvere) that School; vvherein God trains up his in Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Virtue. We ſee vvraſtlers inure themſelves to ſharp Tryals; that they may overcome at laſt: think the ſame of us in this School of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. For that great Maſter of ours is a ſharp and ſevere exerciſer of us; and exacts our labours and patience not only unto ſweat but blood: Suppoſe you that he fondly trains up his, and that he cheriſhes them in the ſoft blandiſhments of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight? No. They are Mothers vvhich ſoften and enervate their children, by an over-tenderneſs
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:101013:100"/>in their education; but Fathers vvho preſerve them, by acquainting them vvith hardſhip. Now God is our Father, and therefore as he doth truly ſo he ſeverely loves us. If you would be a Pilot, you muſt be brought up amongſt ſtormes; if a Souldier, you muſt be trained up in dangers; and if you would be truly a Man, vvhy do you ſtart at afflictions, ſince there is no other vvay to acquire ſtrength. Do you ſee thoſe languiſhing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd Bodies, whom the Sun ſeldom looks upon, the vvind never aſſails, and the more piercing air never lights upon; the Minds of thoſe ſoft and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver happy Men, are ſuch as the leaſt guſt of an angry Fortune vvill over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and diſſolve. Afflictions then do ſtrengthen us, and as trees faſten their roots the deeper by how much the more they are ſhaken with the Winds; ſo good Men become the more fixed in vertue, when attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſtorms of adverſity. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:101013:101"/>do alſo prove and try us; for otherwiſe how ſhall any Man be able to judge of his firmneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency? If a proſperous vvind do ever fill the Sail, the Pilot has no opportunity to diſplay his skill; and if all things ſtill evenly and happily ſucceed to Man, he ſhall loſe the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his vertue; for the only unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable touch-ſtone of it, is affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>It was a gallant Speech of</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius: <hi>Nothing ſeems to me more unhappy than that Man who ha's never taſted of Adverſity, and it is moſt true.</hi> For our Great General doth not exempt ſuch Men, but diſtruſts them; he doth not indulge, but diſcards and contemns them. He raſes I ſay their names out of the Muſter Rolls of his Legions, as a ſort of feeble and unſerviceable perſons. Laſtly, they adapt us to lead on others; for the courage and patience of good Men in their ſufferings, is a light to this benighted World. They invite
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:101013:101"/>others by their example to the ſame things, and as it were trace out a path of vertue for them to walk in. <hi>Bias</hi> loſt at once his Fortunes and his Country; but he yet calls out to Men, that they be ſure to carry all their Treaſure about them. <hi>Regulus</hi> in the midſt of his Torments unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily expir'd: But that excellent and noble example of promiſe keeping doth yet ſurvive. <hi>Papinianus</hi> is ſlain by the Tyrant; but his Axe hath taught us ſecurely to abide it, when we muſt dye in the maintenance of Juſtice. To conclude, there are a number of moſt admirable Perſons, that through violence or injuſtice, have been baniſhed or ſlain: but from thoſe Rivers of blood; we daily ſuck and drink in our improvements in Conſtancy and Vertue: All which notwithſtanding would for ever have been concealed in darkneſs, were it not for this Torch of afflictions. For as Spices do every way emit and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:101013:102"/>their Odours when they are pounded; ſo Vertue doth then chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſplay her Glories, when ſhe is oppreſſed.</p>

                  <p>THe Second End is to Chaſtiſe us, than vvhich there could not be a more gentle or effectual means found out for our preſervation. For it benefits and preſerves us two wayes, either as a ſcourge, vvhen vve have offended, or as a Bridle leſt vve ſhould offend. As a ſcourge, ſince it is the hand of a Father vvhich oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en corrects an offendor for his faults; but it is an Executioner, that ſlowly and only once puniſhes. As vve uſe
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:101013:102"/>fire or vvater for the cleanſing and purging away of filth and droſs: So doth God make uſe of afflictions to take away that of our ſins. And it is deſervedly a ſcourge upon us at this time <hi>Lipſius;</hi> for vve <hi>Belgians</hi> had before offended; and being corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vvith vvealth and pleaſures, vve Ran on Headlong in the Way of Vice. But our God gently warnes and recalls us; and ſcourges us with ſome ſtripes, that forewarned by theſe, we may return to our ſelves and to him. He takes away our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, we abuſed them to Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury; our liberty, becauſe we enlarg'd it to licentiouſneſs? And vvith this gentle <hi>Ferula</hi> of Calamities, he doth (as it were) expiate and purge away our offences. A gentle one indeed, for how ſlight a ſatisfaction is this? They ſay the <hi>Perſians</hi> when they are to puniſh ſome Illuſtrious and great Perſon, uſe to ſtripp him of his Robes and Tiara; and hanging them up
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:101013:103"/>they ſcourge theſe inſtead of the Man: So doth this Father of ours, vvho in every of his chaſtiſements overpaſſes us, and touches onely upon our Bodies, our Lands, our Goods, and our ourward Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This Chaſtiſement ſerves us alſo for a bridle, vvhich he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely caſts over us, when he ſees vve are about to offend. As Phyſitians do ſometimes adviſedly breath a vein, not becauſe we are ſick, but that we may not be; ſo by theſe Calamities God doth vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from us ſome ſuch things, as would otherwiſe become incentives and fewel to our Vices. For he vvho gave a being to all things doth vvell underſtand their Natures; nor doth he judge of their Diſeaſes, by the Complexion and Pulſe; but by the Heart and Reins. Doth he ſee the Genius of the <hi>Hetrurians</hi> to be over-haughty and raiſed? He rules them by a Prince: The <hi>Helvetians</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:101013:103"/>eaſy and quiet? He indulges them liberty: The <hi>Venetians</hi> of a temper betwixt both? He fits them vvith a middle vvay of Government; and vvill poſſibly change all theſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; as the perſons ſhall vary their Conditions. Nevertheleſs, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and vvhy (ſay vve) are vve longer harras'd vvith vvar than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? and vvhy are vve crush'd under a heavier Yoke of ſervitude? Thou Fool, and now really ſick! Art thou vviſer than thy Maker? Tell me vvhy doth the Phyſitian pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe more Wormwood or Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore for this than for that Man? Is it not becauſe his Diſeaſe or Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution requires it? Think the ſame here; poſſibly he ſees this people more ſtubborn, and therefore to be ſubdued by ſtripes; that other more tractable and apt to be reduced with the ſhaking of the Rod. But you do not think ſo: It may be ſo. Our Parents vvill not truſt a Knife or
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:101013:104"/>Sword in the Hand of their Child (though he cry for it) as foreſeeing his hurt. Why then ſhould God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge us to our deſtruction; ſince vve are truly Children, and neither know how to ask thoſe things which are expedient for us; nor how to part vvith thoſe that will be fatal to us? You may therefore lament if you pleaſe, and as much as you pleaſe, but you ſhall notwithſtanding drink of that cup of ſorrowes, vvhich that Heavenly Phyſitian preſents you with, and vvhich he hath (not unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) filled ſo full for you.</p>

                  <p>PUniſhment I confeſs reſpects evil Men, but is no evil it ſelf. For Firſt, it is good if you reſpect God, whoſe eternal and immoveable law of Juſtice doth require that the crimes of Men be either amended, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the vvay.

                  <p>It is good: Thirdly, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thoſe very perſons that are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. For it is for their ſakes; ſince it is not ſo properly a revenge, or an utterly deſtroying judgement, as a gentle cohibition and reſtraint from

To conclude all puniſhment is good, as it reſpects juſtice, as on the contrary impunity is evil, which makes Men ſinful, that is miſerable Men to continue ſo longer. Boetius <hi>ſaid well, wicked

                  <p>THeſe are the three certain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Ends, vvhich I have paſs'd vvith a ſure and ſteady Foot: the fourth remains vvhich I muſt adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon with a doubtful one. For it is more remov'd and obſcure, than that our humane capacities ſhould
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:101013:106"/>perfectly reach it. I diſcover it only through a Cloud, and I may gueſs and offer at it, but never certainly know and attain to it. The End vvhich I mean hath a double reſpect and regards either the conſervation or the beauty of the Univerſe. I therefore ſuppoſe it is for its conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; becauſe that God who made and diſpoſed all things by an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wiſdom; did ſo make them, that he bounded every of them within a certain number, meaſure, and weight: Nor can any particular Creature tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs theſe limits, vvithout the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or ruine of the vvhole. Thus thoſe great bodies the Heavens, the Earth, the Sea have their bounds; thus every Age hath its appointed num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and thus both Men, Cities, and Kingdomes have their ſtated accounts. Will they exceed theſe? It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that ſome ſtorme and tempeſt of Calamities do check and retard them: For otherwiſe they vvould endanger
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:101013:107"/>and bring damage to, this beautiful frame of the World. But thoſe things eſpecially vvould exceed theſe bounds very often, that are under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Encreaſe and Multiply. Look upon Men, who can deny that by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vve are born faſter, than we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally dye? So that in a few years from two perſons a family of a hundred may be propagated; of vvhich in that ſpace not above ten or twenty may dye. Look upon a flock of Sheep; how numerous would the encreaſe be, if the Shepheard ſhould not year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chooſe out and ſet apart ſome to the Slaughter? The Birds and Fiſhes vvould in a ſhort time fill the Air and Waters, if there vvere not certain diſſentions; and (as it vvere) vvarrs amongſt themſelves, and the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Men to diminiſh them. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very age is building of Cities and Towns; and if fire or other wayes of deſtruction ſhould not interpoſe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this vvorld of ours, nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:101013:107"/>vvorld vvould be able to contain them. The ſame may vve imagine of the vvhole Creation. What won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore is it if our <hi>Saturn</hi> doth ſometimes thruſt his Sickle into this over-grown Field; and reap thence ſome ſuperfluous thouſands, either by the peſtilence or vvarr? Which if he ſhould not do, vvhat Country vvould be able to hold us, or vvhat Land could afford us ſuſtenance? It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requiſite that ſomething ſhould periſh from the parts; that ſo the vvhole may be eternal. For as to Rulers in States the ſafety of the People is the ſupream Law: So is it to God in reſpect of the World. For the beauty or Ornament of the World I conceive calamities make two vvayes. Firſt, becauſe I apprehend no beauty any where in this great frame without variety, and a diſtinct ſucceſſion and change of things. I acknowledge the Sun is exceedingly beautiful, but he becomes more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:101013:108"/>to us at his return; through the interpofition of the dew-engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Night; and thoſe black Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains vvhich ſhe ſhuts him out vvith. The Summer is a moſt pleaſant ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but yet the vvinter ſets it off, vvith it's icy marbles, and hoary Froſts: Which if you take away, you really deſtroy the true relliſh, and that particular guſt of Joy, which it's light and Warmth afford us. In this Country of ours, one and the ſame face of things delights me not; but I am pleaſingly affected to behold the Valleys and Hills, and Rocks, fruitful and vvaſt places, Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Woods, for ſatiety and loathing are alwayes the Companions of Equality. And vvhy then in this Scene of life (as I may ſo call it) ſhould the ſame dreſs and countenance of things delight us? In my Mind it ſhould not: Let there be ſometimes ſome ſmooth and Halcyon Calmes; and let thoſe after a while be diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:101013:108"/>and ruffled vvith the vvhirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvinds of Warr, and the boyſterous ſtormes of ſucceeding Tyrannies. For who would wiſh that this Univerſe ſhould be like the dead Sea; without Wind or Motion? But there is alſo another Ornament vvhich I gueſs at vvhich is more ſerious and inwardly fruitful. Hiſtories informe me, that better and ſmoother times, do ſtill ſucceed ſtorms. Do Warrs moleſt any people? Yet for the moſt part they refine and ſharpen them; by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing the Arts, and a various cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ingenuity. The <hi>Romans</hi> of old impos'd a heavy yoke upon the world; but vvithall it prov'd a happy one in the event; for as the Sun chaſes away darkneſs from our Eyes: So did that ignorance and barbariſme from their Minds. What had the <hi>Gaules</hi> or we <hi>Germans</hi> now been, if the light of that great Empire had not riſen to us? A ſort of wild and inhumane ſavages, glutting our ſelves with our own and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:101013:109"/>others blood; and deſpiſers both of God and Man. And if I rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, the ſame will befal this new World; vvhich the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with an advantageous kind of cruelty have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; but vvill again reſtore, and otherwiſe repleniſh. And as thoſe vvho have great plantations; remove ſome trees elſewhere, and cut down others: Skilfully diſpoſing all things, to make them more fruitful and to proſper the better: So doth God in this vaſt Field of the World. For he is the moſt excellent improver, in ſome places he prunes and cuts off the luxuriant branches of ſome Families, and in others (as I may ſo ſay) he plucks off ſome leaves of perſons. This helps the ſtock, though the branches fall, and the leaves that drop off, become the mockery of the vvinds. He ſees this Nation ſcorched and vvithered away; as having out-liv'd their Vertues, and he caſts them out. That other he obſerves to be vvild
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:101013:109"/>and unfruitful; he therefore transfers them; and others he mingles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and engrafts them (as it vvere) into one another. You <hi>Italians</hi> in the declining of the Empire, being now decayed and enfeebled: Why cumber you any longer that choice part of Earth? Depart and let thoſe hardy and unbroken <hi>Lombards</hi> more happily improve that ſoil. You vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and effeminate <hi>Graecians</hi> periſh and let the harſh and ſowre <hi>Scythians</hi> be mellowed there.

All which and more <hi>Lipſius</hi> will readily occurre to him that is ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Hiſtories and the Events of things.

For it is neceſſary that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very cauſe be both before and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than its effect; but than God and his Will, there is nothing either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or greater. There is therefore no cauſe of it. God ſtrikes, and God paſſes by; vvhat would you have more? As <hi>Salvian</hi> ſayes piouſly and truly; the vvill of God is the perfection of Juſtice: But you vvill ſay, vve deſire ſome reaſon of this inequality from, vvhom? from God? To vvhom alone it is lawful to do vvhatſoever he pleaſes, and vvho is pleaſed to do nothing but vvhat is lawful? Shall a Servant call his Maſter; or a Subject his Prince to account?

                  <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Yet to ſatisfie the curious, three uſual Objections are anſwered: Firſt, of that; that evil Men are not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. To which is reply'd; that though their puniſhments are defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they are not remitted. And this comes to paſs either for Mans ſake, or from the Nature of God which is ſlow to Revenge.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THis rude and ſimple vvay <hi>Lipſius</hi> is here the only ſafe one; the reſt are ſlippery and deceitful. In ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour and divine things, the only acuteneſs is to diſcern nothing; and the only knowledge is to be ignorant. But foraſmuch as this Cloud hath heretofore, and doth ſtill reſt upon the Minds of Men; in a few words (if poſſible) I ſhall endeavour to remove it, and vvaft you (now at a-ſtand) over
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:101013:113"/>this River alſo. Pardon me, O thou Heavenly Mind ſaid he (lifting up his Eyes) if I ſhall deliver any thing of theſe ſecrets (yet vvith a pious inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) leſs pure and pious than I ought. And firſt of all <hi>Lipſius</hi> methinks I am able in general to vindicate the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God vvith this one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If God doth behold humane things, he doth alſo care for them, if he cares for them, he governs them, if he governes them it is with judgement, and if vvith judgement, how then unjuſtly? For vvithout judgement there is no government, but a meer heap, confuſion and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult. What have you to oppoſe againſt this Javelin; What Shield or vvhat armes? If you vvill confeſs it, nothing but humane ignorance; I cannot conceive (ſay you) vvhy theſe ſhould be puniſh'd, and thoſe other eſcape. Be it ſo; vvill you therefore add impudence to your imprudence; and carp at the power of that Divine
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:101013:114"/>Lavv, vvhich you cannot conceive of? What more unjuſt way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt juſtice can there be than this? If any ſtranger ſhould take upon him to judge of the Laws and Conſtitutions of your Country; you vvould command him to deſiſt and be ſilent, becauſe he underſtands them not, and ſhall you vvho are the inhabitant of earth, preſume raſhly to cenſure the Laws of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, you underſtand not? Or you that are the vvork to queſtion your Maker? But it matters not, go on, for I ſhall now come up more cloſe to you, and diſtinctly examine (as you deſire me) theſe miſty ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies of yours by the Sun of Reaſon. Three things you object, that God doth not puniſh the vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; that he doth puniſh the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and that he ſubſtitutes and and exchanges offendours. You ſay firſt divine vengeance doth ill to paſs by vvicked men. Doth it then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpaſs
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:101013:114"/>them? In my apprehenſion it doth not, but rather deferrs their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. If divers Men owe me money; and I require it of this deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour aſſoon as it becomes due, and allow to that other a longer time of payment: Am I therefore culpable? Or are not theſe things at my own diſpoſe? The ſame does our Great God; to vvhom all vvicked men owe a puniſhment: He requires it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of theſe, but gives day to others; yet to be paid with intereſt, and what injuſtice is this? unleſs (poſſibly) you are ſolicitous for God, and fear he ſhould loſe part of his debt, by his merciful forbearance: But you need not fear it; no Man ever prov'd bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt to this ſupream Creditour. We are all under his Eye vvhereſoever we betake our ſelves; nay already in his ſhackles and cuſtody. But I vvould (ſay you) have ſuch a Tyrant imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately puniſhed, that by his preſent ſlaughter, he may ſatisfie ſo many as
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:101013:115"/>he hath oppreſſed. For this vvay the Juſtice of God vvould ſhine out the more illuſtriouſly to us. Rather your ſtupidity in my Mind. For vvho art thou that not only preſumeſt to lead on the judgements of God, but alſo to preſcribe him his ſeaſon? Do you think him your judge, or rather your Lictour or Executioner? Diſpatch, lead him off (ſay you) ſcourge him, cover his face, and hang him up: For it is my vvill it ſhould be ſo. O im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence! But God vvills it otherwiſe, vvho (you ought to know) ſees more clearly into theſe matters, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es for other ends. The heats of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and a certain deſire of Revenge tranſport us; from all vvhich God is moſt remotely diſtant, and intends the vvarning and correction of others: For he beſt knowes to vvhom and vvhen theſe things may be uſeful. The choice of times is of great moment, and for vvant of a due and ſeaſonable adminiſtration, the ſafeſt medicines
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101013:115"/>do oftentimes prove fatal to us. He took away <hi>Caligula</hi> in the firſt ſetting out of his Tyranny: He ſuffered <hi>Nero</hi> to run on longer, and <hi>Tiberius</hi> beyond either; and this no doubt for the good of thoſe very Men, vvho then alſo complain'd. Our vicious and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected manners, do often ſtand in need of a laſting and continued ſcourge, though vve vvould have it ſtraight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, and thrown into the Fire. This is one cauſe of the forbearance of God, vvhich reſpect us; the other reſpects himſelf. To vvhom it ſeems natural to proceed on to his Revenge vvith a ſlow pace; and to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the delay of his puniſhment vvith the vveignt of it. <hi>Synecius</hi> ſaid vvell, the Divine inquiſition moves on ſlowly and by degrees: And ſo did the Ancients vvho from this property of his; feign'd God to have feet of Wool. So that although you are paſſionately haſty of Revenge; you cannot yet accuſe this delay, ſince it
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101013:116"/>is ſo only a reſpite of puniſhment; that it may be alſo an encreaſe. Tell me, vvere you preſent at a Tragedy; vvould you ſtomach it that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treus</hi> there, or the <hi>Thyeſtes;</hi> in the firſt or ſecond act, ſhould in a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious garbe, and vvith a ſtately tread, paſs through the Scenes: That they ſhould rule there, threaten and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all? I ſuppoſe you would not, for you know that felicity is but ſhort-liv'd: And expect that all this gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur ſhould finiſh in a fatal Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe. In this Play and Fable of the World, vvhy are you more offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vvith God, than you vvould be vvith any Poet? That wicked Man flouriſhes, and that Tyrant lives hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Be it ſo; but think vvithall that this is but the firſt Act: And before poſſeſs your ſelf inwardly vvith this, that tears and ſorrows preſs on hard to overtake thoſe joyes. This Scene ſhall ſhortly flow vvith blood, and then thoſe robes of Gold, and Purple ſhall
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:101013:116"/>be rowled up and down, and tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in it. For that great Maſter of ours is a good Poet, and vvill not raſhly exceed the Lawes of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy. Do vve not vvillingly bear with Diſcords in Muſick for ſome time; becauſe vve know that the laſt clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures vvill end in comfort? Do ſo here. But you vvill ſay thoſe miſerable Creatures that have ſuffered under this Tyranny, do not alwayes ſee the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. What wonder is it? For the Play is oftentimes ſomewhat long; and they are not able to ſit it out in this Theatre. But others ſee it and fear; becauſe they ſee that though (in this ſevere Court of Judicatory) ſome Men are reprieved; yet they are not pardoned: And though the day of execution is prolonged, yet it is not forgot. Wherefore <hi>Lipſius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this; that vvicked Men are ſometimes forborne, but never acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Nor is there any Man that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains a crime into his breſt, but

                  <p>WHich notwithſtanding that you may more clearly apprehend; and that I may once lead you into the height of this cauſe: You muſt know;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101013:117"/>that Divine puniſhments are threefold; Internal, Poſthumous, and External. Thoſe I call Internal vvhich are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the Soul, vvhile it is yet in the Body; ſuch are Anxiety, Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, Fears, and a thouſand pangs and ſtings of Conſcience. Thoſe are Poſthumous; vvhich are inflicted upon the ſame Soul, but then vvhen it is freed and ſeparate from the Body. Such are thoſe torments which even the Ancients (moſt of them) vvere of opinion did await the vvicked after Death. The third ſort are ſuch as touch upon the Body, or the things that belong to it; as Poverty, Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Pain, Diſeaſes, Death. All vvhich do (ſometimes) by the juſt Judgment of God concurr againſt the Wicked; but the two former alwayes. To ſpeak of internal puniſhments; vvhere ſhall we find the Man, ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely and audaciouſly wicked; that hath not ſenſibly felt in his Soul ſome of theſe ſharp ſcourges, and ſtripes
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101013:118"/>either in the Commiſſion of his crimes or at leaſt after he hath acted them. So true is that vvhich <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid of old; that puniſhment treads upon the heels of ſin: or as <hi>Heſiod</hi> more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, it is coeval and twinns with it. The puniſhment of evil is not only ally'd to; but is bred vvithin that evil. nor is there any thing in this Life, that can pretend to calmneſs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; beſides innocence alone. As the <hi>Roman</hi> cuſtome did enforce the Malefactour to bear that Croſs which vvas ſtreight to bear him: So hath God impos'd upon all wicked Men, this Croſs of Conſcience; on vvhich they ſhall begin to ſuffer, before their further and vvorſe ſufferings do begin. Do you ſuppoſe that only to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which we can look upon, and which this Body doth ſenſibly undergo? No. All thoſe external things do but lightly, and for no long time touch upon us; they are the internal that more exquiſitely torment us. As
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101013:118"/>we judge them to be more deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſick, who languiſh away under an inward waſte; than thoſe that are ſeiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vvith ſome viſible inflammation, or preternatural heats, though theſe laſt are more apparent: So are vvicked Men under a more grievous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vvho vvith ſo low and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible procedures are lead on to their eternal Death. It uſed to be the cruel command of <hi>Caligula;</hi> ſo ſtrike as that he may feel he dyes; the ſame befalls theſe Men, vvhom their Conſcience as an Executioner, doth daily torture, and even kill by theſe ſlow degrees of leſſer and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtripes. Nor let the ſplendour or the inlarged power and vvealth of thoſe Men impoſe upon you: Since they are no more happy and fortunate for theſe than they are healthful, whoſe Gout or Feaver reſts it ſelf upon a purple Couch. Do you ſee a beggarly Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low repreſent in ſome Play the perſon of a Prince, all Pompous and brave?
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:101013:119"/>You behold him yet vvithout envy; for you know how under thoſe golden Robes his Sores and Filth, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty lye hid: Think the ſame of all thoſe great and proud Tyrants: <hi>In whoſe Minds if they lay open to us ſaith</hi> Tacitus, <hi>we might behold gaſhes and wounds:</hi> For as Bodies are torn with ſtripes; ſo are the Souls of Men mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably dilacerated vvith blood, luſt, and other impious contrivances. They laugh I confeſs ſometimes, but it is no true laughter: They rejoyce, but their joyes are not genuine and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but it fares vvith them as vvith condemned vvretches in a priſon, who endeavour with Dice and Tables to ſhake out of their Memories the thoughts of their execution, but are not able: For the deep impreſſion of their approaching puniſhment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains with them; and the fearful Image of pale Death is continually before their Eyes.

I do not wonder at you: For I ſee here the helm of right reaſon wreſted out of the hands of <hi>Cato</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and this faltering expreſſion falls from him: Divine things have much of obſcurity in them. But yet thou <hi>Lipſius,</hi> thou <hi>Cato,</hi> turn your eyes this way a little. One ſight ſhall reconcile
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:101013:121"/>you both to God. See that ambitious <hi>Caeſar;</hi> that prov'd commander in his own opinion, and in others too al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a God; ſee him ſlain in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate houſe, and by the hands of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours; not falling by a ſingle Death, but ſecured by Three and twenty vvounds; like ſome vvild beaſt, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in his blood (and vvhat vvould you more) in <hi>Pompey's</hi> own Court, and at the foot of <hi>Pompey's</hi> Statue falling a great Sacrifice to that great ſhade. So methinks I pitty <hi>Brutus</hi> ſlain for and vvith his Country in the Fields of <hi>Philippi;</hi> but vvithall I am ſome what ſatisfyed, vvhen not long after I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, thoſe victorious armies like gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatours ſlaughtering one another at his Sepulchre; and one of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> vanquiſhed both by Sea and land; in the Company of three Women, vvith that effeminate Arme of his ſcarce finding the Death he ſought.

                  <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>The Second Objection anſwered, that all have deſerved puniſhment; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard all have offended: That Men cannot judge who is more or leſs cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. 'Tis God only that clearly diſcerns betwixt crimes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt juſtly puniſhes.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BUut (ſay you) there are ſome people puniſhed that are guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and have no vvay deſerved it: For this is your Second complaint or rather Calumny. Unadviſed Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man! Are there then any puniſhed vvho have not deſerved it? Where I beſeech you are thoſe innocent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be found? It is an exceſs of confidence, yes abſolute raſhneſs and preſumption to aſſert thus much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any one ſingle perſon; and ſhall you dare to juſtifie whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But to ſmall purpoſe this; for I am ſatisfyed that all of us have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101013:123"/>and do ſtill every day repeat it. We are born in ſin, and ſo we live in it; and to ſpeak vvith the Satyriſt the Magazeens of Heaven had been long ſince emptyed, if its Thunder-bolts had alwayes fallen upon the Heads of ſuch as deſerved them. For vve muſt not think that as Fiſhes, though encreas'd and bred up in the Sea, do yet retain nothing of its ſaltneſs; ſo Men in the filthineſs of this World ſhould contract nothing of uncleaneſs. If then all are in fault? where are thoſe guiltleſs people you ſpeak of, who have not deſerved the puniſhments they undergo; ſince it is moſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that puniſhment ſhould be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable companion of unrighteouſneſs But you vvill ſay it is the inequality of it that diſpleaſes me: For vve ſee them heavily ſcourged that have but lightly offended; vvhile thoſe that are outragiouſly vvicked, do continue and flouriſh in the height of all their gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs. Would you then vvreſt the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:101013:124"/>ballance out of the hands of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Juſtice, and poiſe it vvith your own vveights agreeable to your own apprehenſions? For vvhat elſe can you mean by that bold pronouncing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the equality or inequality of crimes, otherwiſe than God hath done before you? You are therefore here <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> to conſider of two things: Firſt, that a true eſtimation of the crimes of others, neither can nor ought to be attempted by Man: For how ſhall he do it; that not ſo much as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them? And vvhich vvay ſhall he put an exact difference, betwixt thoſe things vvhich he hath not ſo much as ſeen? For you will eaſily grant it me that it is the Mind that ſins; by the Body and ſenſes indeed as its inſtruments, but yet ſo as that the main buſineſs and vveight of the crime, doth in the mean time depend upon it ſelf. This is ſo exactly true; that if it appear any one hath unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinned; he is clear of the ſin. And
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:101013:124"/>if this be ſo how is it poſſible I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, that you ſhould throughly diſcern of Sin, who are not able to reach to the reſidence and ſeat of it. For ſo farr are you from ſeeing into the Heart and Soul of another; that you cannot attain to the knowledge of your own: It is therefore a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful vanity; and no leſs a temerity, to pretend to the Cenſure and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of ſuch things, as are neither fully ſeen, nor to be ſeen; neither known, nor to be known. Conſider ſecondly, that if what you ſay were true, there were yet neither Evil nor injuſtice done to them. No Evil; becauſe its done for their good, who are preſently puniſhed, even for ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler offences. 'Tis rather the love of God to them; ſince that puniſhment vvhich is delayed is juſtly to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; as portending a heavier judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to come. Neither is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; becauſe (as I ſaid) we have all deſerved puniſhment: Nor can the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:101013:125"/>beſt of us pretend to ſo unblemiſhed a purity; but there vvill be found ſome ſuch ſpots in it, as are to be vvaſhed out (as I may ſay) vvith this ſalt water of Affliction. Forbear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore young-man this intricate purſuit of the reſpects and proportions of crimes: And ſince thou art but an earthly and pedaneous judge; leave it to God, who from his higher tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal vvill determine of it; vvith great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er equity and certainty. 'Tis he only that can diſtinguiſh of our deſerts; and 'tis he alone vvho (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all artificial diſguiſes) can behold both vice and vertue in their proper countenances. Who can impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him vvho equally ſearches into things internal and external; that ſees at once the Body and the Mind, the Tongue and the Heart: And (to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude) thoſe things that are open, vvith thoſe that are recluded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred? Who doth not only moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold our actions themſelves, but
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:101013:125"/>alſo their cauſes, and the vvhole progreſs of them. When <hi>Thales</hi> vvas ask'd, vvhether a Man might hide his evil actions from God: He anſwered truly; no nor his evil thoughts nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whereas on the contrary vve are here ſo benighted; that vve do not only not ſee thoſe cloſe ſins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the boſome, and (as they ſay) vvithin the Buttons; but ſcarcely thoſe vvhich are open and dragged into the light. For vve cannot behold the Crime it ſelf, and the vigour of it; but ſome certain footſteps of it, vvhen it is already committed, and upon its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture: They oftentimes are the beſt Men to us, vvho are the worſt in the ſight of God; as on the contrary they are reprobates in our eſteem, vvho are the choiceſt to him. Forbear therefore (if you are vviſe) to diſcourſe or judge of perſons that deſerve or deſerve not their puniſhments; for ſuch obſcure cauſes as theſe are not to be decided, by ſome light and ſuperficial appearances.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>The Third Objection; that puniſhments are transferred, anſwered. That Men do the ſame; why God doth ſo?</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BUt you have caſt another Cloud upon Juſtice; vvhich I muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe: It is concerning ſubſtitutes. For ſay you it is not ſo juſt that God ſhould transferre puniſhments; and 'tis ſomewhat hard that poſterity ſhould rue the crimes of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours. But vvhere is the wonder and ſtrangeneſs of it. I rather vvonder at theſe vvonderers that they can find a wonder in that which is every day done by themſelves here on Earth. Pray tell me; do not thoſe honours, vvhich for his vertue a Prince hath conferred upon the Anceſtours, deſcend to his poſterity? Yes they do; and ſo alſo
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:101013:126"/>do thoſe mulcts and puniſhments, vvhich are inflicted on him for his offences. In attaindours for treaſon or rebellion it is manifeſt that theſe are guilty; but others ſhare in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment vvhich humane cruelty doth ſo farr enlarge; as to make Lawes that follow the innocent Children vvith perpetual vvants; ſuch as make life a burthen, and death a comfort. Perverſe Minds, who will permit that to be lawful to a Prince or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; which you forbid to God: Who yet if you examine it rightly hath a juſter reaſon for his ſeverity. For all of us in one have ſinned, and rebelled againſt this great King; and through ſo many ſucceſſive Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that firſt blot hath been derived to the unhappy Children: So that there is to God a continued twiſt and chain of Crimes. For inſtance; my Father or yours did not begin to ſin, but all the Fathers of our Fathers: What vvonder then is it if he puniſh
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:101013:127"/>in their poſterity not (properly) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers offences; but ſuch as by a kind of communion of ſeed, have been ſtill linked and coupled together, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſcontinued. But to omit theſe higher ſpeculations, and to deal with you, in a more popular way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. You muſt know this that God joynes thoſe things, vvhich vve (through ignorance and unskilfulneſs) uſe to ſever, and that he conſiders Families, Cities, and Kingdomes; not as divided but as one Body and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: The Family of the <hi>Scipio's</hi> or the <hi>Caeſars</hi> is one thing to him. <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Athens,</hi> for the whole time of their duration, were but one to him; and ſo was the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and that very juſtly, for the Society of the ſame laws, and priviledges, is that bond vvhich unites theſe great bodyes, and intitles them though in ſeveral ages, to a communion in partaking of rewards and puniſhments. Were then the <hi>Scipio's</hi> of old good? That Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101013:127"/>judge vvill remember it to the advantage of their poſterity. Were they Evil? It ſhall be hurtful to them. Were the <hi>Belgians</hi> ſome years ago; Laſcivious, Covetous, Impious? We ſhall ſuffer for it. For in every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal puniſhment, God not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the preſent, but alſo looks back upon paſs'd times; and vvith the vveights of them both, doth moſt equally poiſe the ballance of his Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice. I ſayd in external puniſhments and I vvould have you to obſerve it. For crimes themſelves are not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, nor is there a kind of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them: God forbid there ſhould. But certain puniſhments and corrections only, ſuch as are about us not in us; and which properly reſpect the Body, or eſtate; but not this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Mind of ours. And in all this where is the injury? We are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs willing to be heirs of thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and rewards (if any) that are due to our anceſtours: And if
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101013:128"/>ſo; why do we refuſe the burdens, and puniſhments?</p>

But the Poet could only ſee the effect: He aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to the cauſe; but as in one and the ſame Man, we juſtly puniſh in his old age, that offence, which he committed in his youth: So doth God the elder crimes of Empires and Kingdomes, becauſe in reſpect of their outward communion, they are to him but one conjoyned thing. Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervalls of time do not divide us with him who comprehends all eternity in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101013:128"/>the vaſtneſs of his Mind. Should thoſe martial Wolves, heretofore raſe ſo many Cities, and break ſo many Scepters vvith impunity?

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101013:129"/>new equity is raiſed; and that is a merciful act of Juſtice towards many; which ſeems cruelty upon a few. Does not the School-maſter give the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rula to ſome one of his wantonizing Scholars? And does not a General chaſtize his cowardly Army, by the decimation of them? And both theſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſafeſt conſiderations: becauſe the puniſhment though but of thoſe few does terrify and amend all.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:101013:131"/>with full Sails ſpoom away into the Haven. I diſcover my fourth and laſt Brigade; which I ſhall very cheerfully lead up. And as Marriners in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt when they behold the Twins are full of hopes and mirth: So alſo am I (after all theſe ſtorms) at the appearance of my Twinny Legion. I may ſafely call it ſo after the old cuſtom ſince it is double. And two things I ſhall evince by it; that theſe miſeries which we now ſuffer are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grievous, nor new. Which while I ſhall diſpatch in thoſe few things that remain yet to ſay; ſee <hi>Lipſius,</hi> that you be attentive. Never more <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> (reply'd I) for it joyes me to have paſſed theſe difficulties; and after theſe ſcrious and ſeverer Medicines, I greedily long after this gentle and more popular one; for ſo the Title promiſes me it is. Nor are you mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken ſaid <hi>Langius,</hi> for as Phyſitians after they have ſufficiently made uſe of Cauſticks and Inciſions; do not ſo
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101013:131"/>caſt off and relinquiſh their patients; but apply ſome gentle ſomentations, and other remedies to aſſwage their pains: So will I deal vvith you; whom (becauſe I have enough followed with the ſharper methods of wiſdom) I will now cheriſh with milder diſcourſes, and handle (as they ſay) vvith a Ladies hand. I ſhall deſcend from that ſteep hill of Philoſophy; and take a turn or two vvith you, in the pleaſant plains of your Philology, and that not ſo much to recreate you as to compleat your cure. As they ſay <hi>Demochares</hi> the Phyſitian did to the Lady <hi>Conſidia</hi> ſince ſhe refuſed all harſher preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he cauſed her to drink the Milk of Goats; but yet ſuch as he had fed vvith the Branches of the Lentisk Tree: So I vvill adminiſter to you, Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical and pleaſing things, vvhich yet ſhall have a ſecret tincture of the juice of Wiſdom. What matter is it how vve cure our patient, ſo vve make a perfect cure of it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIX. <hi>That publick Evils are not ſo great as they ſeem, proved firſt by Reaſon. That we fear the circumſtance and dreſs of things rather than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>MArch on then my Legion; and before the reſt, let that cohort firſt advance, vvith vvhich vve ſhall maintain that theſe publick evils are not grievous, this ſhall be performed vvith the double vveapon of reaſon and compariſon of reaſon. Firſt, for if vve reſpect that, all thoſe evils which are either preſent or imminent, are not really either great or grievous, but are ſo only in appearance. It is Opinion that heightens and aggravates our calamities, and preſents them to us in ſo tragical a garbe. But (if you are wiſe) diſperſe this circumjected
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:101013:132"/>Cloud, and examine things by a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er light. For inſtance, you fear Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty amongſt theſe publick Evils, Baniſhment, Death: All which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, if you look upon them vvith a perfect and ſetled Eye, vvhat are they? If you examine them by their own juſt vveights, how light are they? This Warr or Tyranny by multiplyed contributions vvill exhauſt you; vvhat then? You ſhall be a poor Man. Did not Nature it ſelf bring you into the World ſo? And vvill it not hurry you thence in the ſame manner? But if the deſpiſed and infamous name of it, diſpleaſe you; change it, call your ſelf free and delivered. For For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune (if you know it not) hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdened you and placed you in a ſecurer ſtation, vvhere none ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt you any more: So that vvhat you eſteemed a loſs, is no other than a remedy. But ſay you I ſhall be an exile; call it (if you pleaſe) a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. If you change your affection;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:101013:133"/>you change your Country. A vviſe Man vvhereſoever he is, is but a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer; a Fool is ever baniſhed. But I daily expect Death from the Tyrant: As if you did not do the ſame from Nature. But that is an infamous Death that comes by the Ax or Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Fool! nor that nor any other Death is infamous; unleſs your life be ſo. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to your thoughts all the excellent and more illuſtrious perſons ſince the vvorld began; and you ſhall find them ſnatched away by a violent and untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Death. Thus <hi>Lipſius</hi> you muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine (for I have given you but a taſt) all thoſe things vvhich have ſo fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full an appearance, you muſt look upon them naked and apart, from thoſe vizards and diſguiſes; vvhich opinion hath put upon them. But alaſs poor creatures; vve gaze only upon the vain outſides of things: Nor do vve dread the things themſelves, ſo much as we do the circumſtantial dreſſes of them. If you put to Sea, and it ſwell high, your
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:101013:133"/>heart fails, and you tremble at ſuch a rate, as if (ſhould you ſuffer Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack) you were to ſwallow it all; vvhen alaſs one or two Sextaries would be ſufficient. If there be a ſudden Earth-quake; what a cry, and vvhat fears it raiſes? You apprehend imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, that the vvhole City (or houſe at leaſt) vvill fall upon you: Not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how ſufficient any ſingle ſtone is to perform the vvork of Death. 'Tis thus in all theſe calamities; in vvhich it is the noiſe and vain image of things that chiefly affrights us. See that Guard; theſe Swords. And what can that Guard, or thoſe Swords do? They vvill kill. And vvhat is that being kill'd? 'Tis only a ſingle Death; and leſt that name ſhould affright you: It is the departure of the Soul from the Body. All thoſe military troops, All thoſe threatning Swords, ſhall perform no more than vvhat one Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, one Grapeſtone, or one Inſect can do. But this is the harſher vvay of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:101013:134"/>dying. Rather it is much the milder; for that Feaver vvhich you vvould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr, does often torture a Man for a year together; but theſe diſpatch him vvith a blow, in an inſtant. <hi>Socrates</hi> therefore ſaid vvell; vvho vvas vvont to call all theſe things by no other name than that of Goblins and Viz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, vvhich (if you put on you) will fright the children; but if you take them off again, and appear vvith your own face, they'l come again to you and embrace you. 'Tis the very ſame vvith theſe evils; vvhoſe Vizzards if you pluck off, and behold them apart from their diſguiſes; you vvill confeſs you vvere ſcared vvith a childiſh fear. As Hail falling upon a houſe daſhes it ſelf in pieces: So if theſe calamities light upon a conſtant Mind, they do not break it but themſelves.</p>

This Age ſay you is the moſt unhappy.

Nature has ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted this into the Diſpoſition of Man; to look fixedly upon his Evils; and to ſhut his Eyes upon his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:101013:140"/>I ſay it was ſo exhauſted and lop't with a conſtant continued Ax of Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; That <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us (which I never read without wonder and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation) all of it in his age was not able to muſter up three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Souldiers; which number yet, the one ſmall City of <hi>Megara</hi> (ſaith he) had formerly ſet forth in the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Warr. Ah! whither art thou fallen, thou once the glory of the Earth, the light and leader of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? There is ſcarce a Town at this day (of any name) in this our vvaſted <hi>Belgia,</hi> but is able to raiſe ſuch a number of Men fit to bear Armes. Let us take now a view of <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Romans. Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Oroſius</hi> have already eaſed me of this trouble. Conſult them and there you vvill meet vvith Seas of evils. The ſecond <hi>Punick</hi> vvarr it ſelf, in leſs than ſeventeen years (for I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly computed it) conſumed in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spain</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> only, above fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:101013:141"/>hundred thouſand men. The civill vvar betwixt <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> three hundred thouſand. And the Arms of <hi>Brutus, Caſſius,</hi> and <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> a greater number. But why ſhould I inſiſt upon ſuch Warrs, as were managed by the conduct of ſeveral Commanders? That one <hi>Caius Caeſar</hi> (the plague and poyſon of mankind) confeſſes and that in a vvay of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, that there fell by him in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral batails, eleven hundred ninety and two thouſand men; not recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into this number the ſlaughters of the civil Warrs; But only thoſe of forraign Nations, which he had made in thoſe few years wherein he had the Government of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Gaul.</hi> In which notwithſtanding (greater in this too) the Great <hi>Pompey</hi> out-went him; who wrote in the Temple of <hi>Minerva</hi> that there were by him vanquiſhed, put to flight, ſlain and taken One and twenty hundred, and eighty three thouſand men. To theſe (if you will)
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:101013:141"/>you may adde <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> vvho ſlew one hundred and ten thouſand <hi>Gauls. Caius Marius</hi> two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Cimbrians.</hi> And in the latter ages <hi>Aetius</hi> vvho in that memorable <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>launican</hi> Field ſlevv one hundred ſixty two thouſand <hi>Hunnes.</hi> And leſt you ſhould think that in theſe Warrs, there vvere only Carcaſes of Men; there vvere thoſe of Cities too. That <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſour boaſts that he took more Towns in <hi>Spain</hi> than he continued dayes there: <hi>Sempronius Gracchus</hi> (if vve may believe <hi>Polybius</hi>) raiſed Three hundred in the ſame <hi>Spain,</hi> nor hath any age (as I think) any thing to add to theſe Examples; unleſs it be our own, though acted in another World. A few <hi>Spaniards</hi> about Eighty years ago; paſſing over into thoſe vaſt and nevv found Lands: Good God! vvhat funeralls, vvhat ſlaughters did they make? I do not diſcourſe the cauſes and juſtneſs of that Warr; but only the events. I ſee that huge ſpace of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:101013:142"/>Earth (vvhich eertainly vvas a great enterprize to diſcover, not to ſay to overcome) overrun by twenty or thirty Souldiers, and thoſe unarmed multitudes every vvhere mow'd down as corn is by the ſythe. Where art thou <hi>Cuba</hi> the greateſt of Iſlands, <hi>Haytus</hi> or you <hi>Iucayans?</hi> Which heretofore were each of you guarded vvith ſix or ten hundred thouſand men; but have now (ſome of you) ſcarce preſerved fifteen of them for ſeed. Shew thy ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhile thou <hi>Peru</hi> and thou <hi>Mexico.</hi> O vvonderful and miſerable face! that immenſe tract, and ſuch as may vvell be called another World, appears vaſt and deſolate, in ſuch a manner as if it had been blaſted vvith a fire from Heaven. My Tongue and Heart fail me <hi>Lipſius,</hi> as oft as I remember theſe things; and I look upon all that hath befallen us (in compariſon of theſe) to be but pieces of ſtrawes (as the Comaedian vvords it) or little mites. Nor do I here repreſent to you, the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:101013:142"/>condition of captivity, than vvhich nothing vvas more bitter in the Warrs of the Ancients. Free, noble, Men, Women and Children, all ſorts vvere hurried away by the Victour; and vvho knowes but it vvas into eternal ſlavery? Into ſlavery it vvas. The footſteps of vvhich, I juſtly rejoyce, have not been nor yet are in the Chriſtian World.

                  <p>BUt you goe forward in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and ſpeak of the plague and Famine, of Taxes and Rapines. Will you then that we proceed vvith each of theſe in our compariſon, though briefly. Tell me in theſe five or ſix years, how many thouſands, hath this plague ſnatched away in all <hi>Belgia?</hi> As I gueſs fifty or at the moſt one hundred thouſand. But in <hi>Iudaea</hi> a ſingle plague in the reign of King <hi>David,</hi> ſwept away ſeventy thouſand in leſs than a day. When <hi>Gallus</hi> and <hi>Voluſianus</hi> vvere Emperours, a plague beginning in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through all the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces;
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:101013:143"/>and for fifteen years together did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibly exhauſt them. Nor did I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read of a mortality that laſted ſo long, or that ſpread it ſelf ſo vvide. But that vvhich ſeiſed upon <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> and the neighbouring places in the reign of <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Emperour is more remarkable for the fury and fierceneſs of it: vvhich vvas ſuch that it made every day five thouſand fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals and ſometimes ten. I ſhould not be forward to ſpeak this; but ſhould my ſelf remain doubtful of the credit of this report: vvere it not confirmed by unqueſtionable vvitneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that lived in the ſame age. Nor vvas that <hi>African</hi> plague leſs vvonderful, vvhich began upon the ruine of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> and deſtroyed in <hi>Numidia</hi> alone eighty thouſand men, in the Sea coſts of <hi>Africa</hi> two hundred thouſand: about <hi>Vtica</hi> thirty thouſand Souldiers left there as the guard of thoſe parts. Again in <hi>Greece</hi> in the reign of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Ducas</hi> there was ſo raging a
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:101013:144"/>plague that (they are <hi>Zonaras</hi> his vvords) the living did not ſuffice to bury the dead. To conclude in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarchs</hi> time (as himſelf reports it) ſo direful a one ſate brooding upon <hi>Italy,</hi> that of every thouſand men ſcarce ten ſurvived. I come now to ſpeak of Famine: Certainly vve of this Age have ſeen nothing, if vve conſider the times paſt. When <hi>Honorius</hi> vvas Emperour, there vvas ſuch a dearth and ſcarcity of all ſorts of proviſions, that men vvere ready to eat one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, For it vvas openly cried at the Cirque, ſet the price of mans fleſh. In the reign of <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> throughout <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi> (after the <hi>Goths</hi> had vvaſted it) there vvas one ſo great, that in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenum</hi> alone, there vvere fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men famiſhed to death: and all about, they eat not only the fleſh of men, but their own excrements. Two vvomen (I tremble to ſpeak it) had at ſeveral times by night treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly killed ſeventeen men and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:101013:144"/>them: and vvere themſelves ſlain by the eighteenth who had diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their practiſe. I forbear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the famine in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and the vvell known examples of it there. If I muſt ſay ſomething of Taxes alſo; I deny not but they are heavy ones with which we are preſſed. But they are ſuch only, vvhen you look upon them by themſelves; not when you compare them vvith thoſe of old. All, moſt all the Provinces of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire, payed yearly the fifth part of the profits of their paſture, and the tenth of their arable. Nor did <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> forbear to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the tributes of nine or ten years to be payed in one. When <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> vvas ſlain, and armes were taken up for their liberty, every Citizen was commanded to pay down the five and twentyeth part of all their goods. And more than this all that were Senatours payed for every tile of their houſe ſix aſſes. An immenſe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:101013:145"/>contribution, above the reach of our ſenſes as vvell as of our Eſtates. But <hi>Octavianus Caeſar</hi> (probably vvith ſome reference to his name,) exacted and received of all freed men the eighth part of their Eſtates. I omit vvhat the Triumvir's and other Tyrants have done, leſt I ſhould teach thoſe of our times, by the recitall of them. Let that one of Colonies, be inſtead of all examples of Exactions and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines. An invention then vvhich no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing did more contribute to the ſtrength of the Empire: and nothing could be deviſed more grievous to the Subject. Veterane Legions and Cohorts were drawn out into Towns and Fields, and the miſerable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials, (in a moment of time) were thruſt out of all their Eſtates and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and that for no offence or unlawful attempt, their riches onely and plentiful poſſeſſions vvere their crimes. In vvhich certainly the ſum of all calamities is comprized. It's a
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:101013:145"/>great misfortune to be robbed of our money, vvhat is it then to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of our houſes and lands? And if it is grievous to be driven thence: vvhat is it to be forced from our Country, our Temples and Altars? You might ſee ſome thouſands of woful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hurryed away, children from their Parents, Maſters from their Families, Wives from their Huſbands, and thrown out into divers Countryes, as their lot deſigned them. Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the thirſty <hi>Affricans,</hi> and as the Poet ſaith in this very caſe,
<q>
                        <l>

                  </head>
                  <p>BUt yet (ſay you) there are ſuch cruelties and murthers at this day, as the like have not been heard of. I know vvhat you point at, and vvhat vvas done of late, but I appeal to your conſcience <hi>Lipſius,</hi> vvas their no ſuch thing amongſt the ancients? How ignorant are you if you know it not, and how vvicked if you diſſemble it? For there is ſuch a plenty of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in this matter, and they lye ſo ready, that it is ſome trouble even to chooſe. Know you not the name of <hi>Sylla</hi> the Fortunate? If you doe, you remember that infamous and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el preſcription of his, by vvhich he caſt out of one City four thouſand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:101013:146"/>hundred Citizens. Nor were they of the meaner ſort; but one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty of them vvere Senators. Nor do I touch upon thoſe infinite ſlaughters that were uſually acted either by his permiſſion or command. So that not undeſervedly thoſe words burſt from <hi>Quintus Catulus</hi> vvith vvhom at length ſhall vve live; if in Warr vve kill armed Men, and in peace the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed. But ſhortly after; this ſame <hi>Sylla</hi> vvas imitated by his Diſciples: I mean the triumvirs, vvho in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner proſcribed three hundred Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and above two thouſand Roman Knights. O vvickedneſs! A greater cruelty than this the Sun in all its tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels from the Eaſt unto the Weſt, did never yet behold; nor is like to do hereafter. If you pleaſe you may look into <hi>Appianus;</hi> and there you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the various and deformed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe times: Of thoſe that lay hid, and fled; of thoſe that ſtopped their flight, and halled them forth:
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:101013:147"/>the vvoful vvailings of Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; ſo that you vvould believe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity itſelf had periſhed and fled from that ſavage and inhumane age. Theſe cruelties were acted upon the perſons of Senatours and Knights, that is to ſay, upon ſo many little leſs than Kings and Princes; but poſſibly the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were more favourably dealt with. No ſuch matter. Look upon the ſame <hi>Sylla,</hi> who commanded four Legions of the contrary party (for whoſe ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he had given his faith) to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the publick Villa; they in vain imploring the mercy of his treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous right hand: Whoſe dying groans reaching the Curia and the Senate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtartled and amazed at it: Let us mind our buſineſs Conſcript Fathers, (ſaid he) a few ſeditious fellows are puniſhed by my command. I know not vvhich I ſhould moſt vvonder at; that a Man could do ſo, or that he could ſpeak ſo. Will you have more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of cruelty? Take them. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:101013:147"/>Galba</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> ſummoning the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of three Cities together, as if to communicate to them ſomething to their advantage; ſuddenly commanded ſeven thouſand of them to be ſlain; amongſt vvhich vvas the flower of their youth. In the ſame Country <hi>Lucius Licinius Lucullus</hi> the Conſul ſent his Souldiers into the City of the <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeans,</hi> and ſlew twenty thouſand of them contrary to the Articles agreed upon at their yielding. <hi>Octavianus Auguſtus</hi> vvhen he had taken <hi>Peruſia;</hi> choſe out three hundred of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of both orders, and though they had yielded themſelves, he ſlew them as Sacrifices before an Altar vvhich he had erected to <hi>D. Julius Antonius Caracalla,</hi> (being offended vvith thoſe of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> for I knovv not vvhat jeſts upon him) enters that City in a ſemblance of peace, and vvhen he had commanded all their young Men into the Field; he ſurrounds them vvith his Souldiers, upon a Signal given
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:101013:148"/>he kills them every one, and uſing the ſame cruelty to the remaining multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he utterly exhauſted that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous and moſt frequented City. King <hi>Mithridates</hi> by one letter cauſed eighty thouſand Roman Citizens to be ſlain; that were diſperſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Aſia</hi> about their mercandiſe. <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſus Meſſalla</hi> the Proconſul of <hi>Aſia,</hi> in one day cauſed three hundred to be beheaded; and ſtrutting amongſt the dead bodyes with his armes on his ſides, as if he had done ſome glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous act; cryed out aloud; O Princely deed! Hitherto I have only ſpoken of prophane and impious perſons; but behold amongſt thoſe that are devoted to the ſervice of the true God: You vvill find it of the Emperour <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> that having by the higheſt vvicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deceit, betrayed ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand innocent people of <hi>Theſsaloniea</hi> into the Theatre, under pretence of exhibiting ſome playes; He ſent his Souldiers amongſt them, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

                  <p>LAſtly, you complain of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny that is now adayes, and the oppreſſions at once both of our Bodies and Souls. My purpoſe is not (at this time) to applaud, or condemn our own age; for to what end were it? My buſineſs is to compare only. I ask you therefore when ever thoſe
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:101013:149"/>evils vvere not; and where that place was. Aſſign me any one Age, any one Nation, without a remarkable Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in it; and (for I'le run the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard) I will then confeſs, that we are the moſt wretched of all that are miſerable Why do you not reply? I ſee that old Sarcaſme is true; all the good Princes may be regiſtred in a Ring. For it is natural to Man to uſe authority inſolently, and hardly to keep a mean in that which it ſelf is above it. Even we our ſelves who complain of Tyranny, do yet carry the ſeeds of it incloſed in our boſoms: Nor is there a Will wanting in moſt of us to diſcover them, but the power. A Serpent vvhen he is benummed with cold, hath poyſon within him, though he do not exert it; 'Tis the ſame in us, whom only weakneſs keeps inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and a kind of Winter in our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. Give but power, give means, and I fear that the moſt of thoſe that accuſe would tranſcend the example of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:101013:149"/>their ſuperiours. This is every dayes inſtance; ſee that Father ſtern with his Children, that Maſter with his Servants, and that School-Maſter with his Scholars. Each of them is a <hi>Phalaris</hi> in his kind, and raiſe the ſame waves in their Brooks, as Kings do in their greater Seas. The ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is diſcernible in other creatures; moſt of which prey upon their own kind, both in the Air, the Earth, and the Water:

                     </q> ſayes <hi>Varro</hi> truly; but you will ſay theſe are the oppreſſions of Bodies only: But this is the peculiar of our age, that ours are of the Soul alſo. Take heed you ſpeak not this with more malice than truth. That Man ſeems to me to be little skilled in the knowledge of himſelf, and the heavenly nature of the Soul; that thinks it can be forced or
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:101013:150"/>compelled. For no outward violence whatſoever can make you will, that which you do not will; or to yield to that which you do not aſſent to. Some have power over the bond and tye of the Soul; but none over it ſelf. A ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant may looſe it from the Body, but he cannot diſſolve the nature of it, which being pure, eternal, ſiery, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſes every external or violent attempt. But we may not ſpeak our own thoughts. Be it ſo. The bridle then curbs your Tongue only, not your Mind; your Actions, but not your Judgment. But even this is new, and unheard of. Good Man! how are you miſtaken? How many can I point you out, who have ſuffered under Tyrants, for their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions? through the heedleſneſs of their tongues? How many of thoſe Tyrants have endeavoured to compel mens Judgements, and their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments too in matters of Religion? It vvas the common cuſtom of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> and the Eaſtern Nations to adore
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:101013:150"/>their Kings, and we know that <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> challenged to himſelf that divine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration, with the ill will of his ruder <hi>Macedonians.</hi> Amongſt the Romans that good and moderate Emperour <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> had in the Provinces, yes in every houſe, Flamens and Prieſts as a God. <hi>Caligula</hi> cutting off the Heads from the Statues of the Gods, with a ridiculous impiety, cauſed his own to be placed upon them. The ſame inſtituted a Temple, Prieſts and choſen Sacrifices to his own deity. <hi>Nero</hi> would be taken for <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the moſt illuſtrious of the City were ſlain, under this accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that they had never ſacrificed to the heavenly voice. <hi>Domitian</hi> was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly called our Lord and God. Which vanity or impiety if it were found at this day, in any of our Kings; what vvould you then ſay <hi>Lipſius?</hi> I vvill ſail no nearer this <hi>Scylla,</hi> into which no vvinds of ambition ſhall either betray or force me: For a ſecure old age is the reward of ſilence. I will bring in
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:101013:151"/>only one teſtimony of the ancient ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, in this reſpect; and that ſhall be out of an Author you are well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vvith, and I vvould have you to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him. 'Tis <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the reign of <hi>Domitian: We read</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that when</hi> Petus Thraſea <hi>was praiſed by</hi> Arulenus Ruſticus, <hi>and</hi> Priſcus Helvidius <hi>by</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennius Senecio; <hi>it was capital to them both.

Think vvith your ſelf (ſayes he) how many ſorrows have heretofore been under theſe roofs; now are, and hereafter ſhall be: And then ceaſe to lament the evils of Mankind, as if they vvere your own only. I vviſh I could give you the like proſpect of this vvide World <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> but ſince it is not to be done actually, let us imagine it. I place you upon the top of ſome high Mountain (<hi>Olympus</hi> if you pleaſe) look down now upon all thoſe Cities, provinces and Kingdoms beneath: And think that you ſee but ſo many incloſures of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Calamities; the Amphitheatres, and (as it vvere) the Sands, in vvhich the bloody ſports of Fortune are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited. You need not look farr from
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:101013:153"/>hence; do you ſee Italy? It is not yet thirty years ſince it reſted from ſharp and cruel vvarrs on every ſide. See you the ſpacious <hi>Germany?</hi> The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſparks of a Civil diſcord were there but of late, vvhich threaten to break forth afreſh (and if I am not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) into a more deſtructive flame. Do you ſee <hi>Brittain?</hi> Warrs and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are perpetually in it, and that peace vvhich it now awhile enjoyes; it owes to the government of the middle Sex. See you <hi>France?</hi> Behold and pitty it. Even now the Gangrene of a bloody warr, creeps into all the Joints of it: Nor is it otherwiſe in all the reſt of the World. Think upon theſe things <hi>Lipſius,</hi> and let this communion in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries help to alleviate thoſe of yours. And as they uſed to place a ſlave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Triumpher, who in the midſt of all the joyes of the triumph, vvas often to cry out to him; thou art yet but a Man: So let this Monitour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvayes ſtand by to remember you, that
